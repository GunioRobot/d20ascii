      The planar ranger roams the multiverse instead of the wilderness, learning the secrets of the planes.

      *Class Skills:*
      Eliminate Knowledge (nature) and Knowledge (dungeoneering) from the ranger's class skill list.

      Add Knowledge (the planes) and Speak Language (Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Ignan, Infernal, Terran only) to the class skill list.

      *Class Features:*
      The planar ranger has all the standard ranger class features, except as noted below.

      *Wild Empathy:*
      A planar ranger takes no penalty on wild empathy checks made to influence magical beasts with the celestial or fiendish templates. However, he takes a -4 penalty when using this ability against animals.

      *Animal Companion:*
      A nonevil planar ranger may have a celestial version of a normal animal as his animal companion. A nongood ranger may have a fiendish version of a normal animal as his animal companion.

      *Spellcasting:*
       A planar ranger's spellcasting ability is largely unchanged from that of the standard ranger, with one exception: Any ranger spell that normally affects animals also affects celestial or fiendish versions of animals when cast by a planar ranger.

      The urban ranger stalks the treacherous streets of the city, relying on his knowledge of alleyways and underworld contacts to keep him alive.

      *Class Skills:*

      *Animal Companion:*
      An urban ranger cannot have an animal larger than Medium as his animal companion.

      *Wild Empathy:*
      An urban ranger adds only one-half his class level to wild empathy checks, reflecting his limited connection with the natural world.

      *Favored Enemy:*
      At the game master's discretion, an urban ranger may select an organization instead of a creature type as his favored enemy. For example, a character might select a particular thieves' guild, merchant house, or even the city guard. The favored enemy bonuses would apply to all members of the chosen organization, regardless of their creature type or subtype.

      *Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):*
      An urban ranger can use this ability in any area, whether natural terrain or not.
