      Description: >
        Adepts are skilled with all simple weapons. Adepts are not
        proficient with any type of armor nor with shields.
    Spells:
      Level: 1
      Description: >
        An adept casts divine spells which are drawn from the adept spell
        list.  Like a cleric, an adept must choose and prepare her spells in
        advance.  Unlike a cleric, an adept cannot spontaneously cast cure
        or inflict spells.

        To prepare or cast a spell, an adept must have a Wisdom score equal
        to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty Class for a saving
        throw against an adept's spell is 10 + the spell level + the adept's
        Wisdom modifier.

        Adepts, unlike wizards, do not acquire their spells from books or
        scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study.  Instead, they
        meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them as divine
        inspiration or through their own strength of faith.  Each adept must
        choose a time each day at which she must spend an hour in quiet
        contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of
        spells.  Time spent resting has no effect on whether an adept can
        prepare spells.

        Like other spellcasters, an adept can cast only a certain number of
        spells of each spell level per day.  Her base daily spell allotment
        is given on Table: The Adept.  In addition, she receives bonus
        spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score.

    Summon Familiar:
      Level: 2
      Short: Summon Familiar
      Description: At 2nd level, an adept can call a familiar, just as a sorcerer or wizard can.
