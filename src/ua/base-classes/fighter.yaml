      Fighter Variant: Thug
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      _Source: Unearthed Arcana_

      The thug is a street fighter, a survivor who learns to mix brute force
      with a bit of craftiness.  He has most of the fighter's strengths,
      along with some additional skills to help keep him alive on the mean
      streets.  Despite the name, not all thugs are mere hooligans-many are
      crafty veterans who use their knowledge of the streets to gain an
      advantage against their opponents.
      
      Most thugs are nonlawful, though sometimes gangs of thugs with a
      lawful streak band together.
      
      *Class Skills:*
      Add the following skills to the fighter's class skill list: Bluff,
      Gather Information, Knowledge (local), and Sleight of Hand.  The thug
      gains skill points per level equal to 4 + Int modifier (and has this
      number x4 at 1st level).
