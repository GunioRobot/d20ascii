      Cleric Variant: Cloistered Cleric
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      The cloistered cleric spends more time than other clerics in study and
      prayer and less in martial training.  He gives up some of the cleric's
      combat prowess in exchange for greater skill access and a wider range
      of spells devoted to knowledge (and the protection of knowledge).
      
      Most cloistered clerics are nonchaotic, since they believe that a
      disciplined lifestyle lends itself better to learning.
      
      *Hit Die:*
      The cloistered cleric uses a d6 for his Hit Die (and has hit points at
      1st level equal to 6 + Con modifier).
      
      *Base Attack Bonus:*
      The cloistered cleric's lack of martial training means that he uses
      the poor base attack bonus.
      
      *Class Skills:*
      The cloistered cleric's class skill list includes Decipher Script,
      Speak Language, and all Knowledge skills (from the Knowledge domain,
      see below).  The cloistered cleric gains skill points per level equal
      to 6 + Int modifier (and has this number x4 at 1st level).
      
      Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The cloistered cleric has all the standard cleric class features,
      except as noted below.
      
      *Weapon and Armor Proficiency:*
      Cloistered clerics are proficient with simple weapons and with light
      armor.
      
      *Lore (Ex):*
      Thanks to long hours of study, a cloistered cleric has a wide range of
      stray knowledge.  This ability is identical to the bard's bardic
      knowledge class feature, using the cloistered cleric's class level in
      place of the bard level.
      
      *Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells:*
      Most cloistered clerics worship deities associated with knowledge and
      learning.
      
      In addition to any domains selected from his deity's list, a
      cloistered cleric automatically gains the Knowledge domain as a bonus
      domain (even if the Knowledge domain is not normally available to
      clerics of that deity).  He gains the Knowledge domain granted power
      and may select his bonus domain spell from the Knowledge domain or
      from one of his two regular domains.
      
      *Spellcasting:*
      Add the following spells to the cloistered cleric's class spell list:
      0-message; 1st-erase, identify, unseen servant; 2nd-fox's cunning;
      3rd-illusory script, secret page, tongues (reduced from 4th level);
      4th-detect scrying; 6th-analyze dweomer; 7th-sequester; 9th-vision.

      Some clerics prefer to be champions of good (or evil), standing at the
      forefront of the battle against the enemy.
      
      *Gain:*
      Smite evil, if the cleric would normally channel positive energy, or
      smite good, if the cleric would normally channel negative energy (as
      paladin); aura of courage (as paladin).
      
      *Lose:*
      Turn undead.
