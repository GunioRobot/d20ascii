      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      In literature and lore, the combat styles and aptitudes of a monk
      depend greatly on where (or by whom) she was trained. The standard
      monk, however, presents only a relatively limited variety of options
      to personalize your monk.
      
      A 1st-level monk (regardless of character level) may select one of the
      fighting styles described below. By selecting one of these fighting
      styles, she dictates which bonus feats she gains at 1st, 2nd, and 6th
      level (when a standard monk normally gains one of two bonus feats). In
      addition, at 1st level she gets a +2 bonus on checks involving a skill
      of her selection (in exchange for the freedom of choice she gives up
      by preselecting her bonus feats). Finally, she gains a bonus ability
      at 6th level if she has met the listed prerequisites by that time. If
      the character hasn't yet met the prerequisites, she doesn't gain the
      bonus ability, even if she meets the prerequisites at some later time.
      
      These fighting styles serve a variety of purposes in a campaign. Each
      one might symbolize a different monastery, creating a rivalry
      (friendly or unfriendly) between their students. Perhaps a specific
      master teaches each style only to a few select students, meaning that
      a monk must prove herself worthy before pursuing the training. Or
      maybe each monk simply chooses her own way in life, styling herself
      after great martial artists of the past.
      
      A monk can abandon her fighting style by selecting a different bonus
      feat at 2nd or 6th level; however, if she does so, she loses the bonus
      on skill checks gained at 1st level and never gains the bonus ability
      of the fighting style (even if she meets the prerequisites).
