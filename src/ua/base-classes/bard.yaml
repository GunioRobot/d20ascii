      The bardic sage focuses his efforts on learning, research, and the
      power of knowledge.
      
      Alignment
      ^^^^^^^^^
      The bardic sage must be neutral good, neutral, or neutral evil. The
      true pursuit of knowledge cares little for ethical extremes.  A bardic
      sage who becomes chaotic or lawful cannot progress in levels as a
      bardic sage, though he retains all his bardic sage abilities.
      
      Base Save Bonuses
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The bardic sage has good will saves, but has poor Fortitude and Reflex
      saves.
      
      Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The bardic sage has all the standard bard class features, except as
      noted below.
      
      *Spellcasting:*
      A bardic sage learns and casts spells as a normal bard, with a few
      exceptions.  In addition to the normal number of spells known, a
      bardic sage knows one divination spell of each spell level he is
      capable of casting.  For example, a 1st-level bardic sage knows four
      0-level bard spells plus one 0-level bard spell of the divination
      school (such as detect magic, know direction, or read magic.  The
      bardic sage's number of spells per day does not change.
      
      To learn or cast a spell, a bardic sage must have an Intelligence
      score (not Charisma score) equal to at least 10 + the spell level. 
      All other spellcasting factors, including bonus spells and save DCs,
      are still determined using the bardic sage's Charisma score.  Add the
      following spells to the bardic sage's class spell list: 1st-detect
      chaos/evil/good/law; 2nd-zone of truth; 3rd-arcane sight; 4th-analyze
      dweomer (lowered from 6th), sending; 5th-contact other plane, greater
      scrying (lowered from 6th); 6th-true seeing, vision.
      
      *Bardic Knowledge:*
      A bardic sage gains a +2 bonus on all bardic knowledge checks.
      
      *Bardic Music:*
      A bardic sage's powers of inspiration are not as persistent as those
      of a traditional bard.  His ability to inspire courage, inspire
      greatness, or inspire heroics lasts only 3 rounds after the ally can
      no longer hear the bardic sage sing, rather than the normal 5 rounds.

      Not all bards are arcanists; some derive their special powers from a
      divine tradition.  In many primitive cultures, the divine bard takes
      the place of the cleric or the adept as the guide of the people's
      religious beliefs.
      
      Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The divine bard has all the standard bard class features, except as
      noted below.
      
      *Spellcasting:*
      A divine bard learns and casts spells as a normal bard, with some
      minor exceptions.  A divine bard's spells are divine spells, not
      arcane spells.
      
      To learn or cast a spell, a divine bard must have a Wisdom score (not
      Charisma score) equal to at least 10 + the spell level.  All other
      Spellcasting factors, including bonus spells and save DCs, are still
      determined using the divine bard's Charisma score.
      
      Like druids, paladins, and rangers, divine bards need not designate a
      specific deity as the source of their spells.  However, a divine bard
      can't cast spells of an alignment that doesn't match his.  Thus,
      divine bards cannot cast lawful spells (since bards can't be lawful). 
      Neutral divine bards can't cast any spells associated with an
      alignment (and are thus relatively rare).
      
      Add the following spells to the divine bard's class spell list:
      0-create water, cure minor wounds; 1st-detect evil/good/law,
      protection from evil/good/law; 2nd-consecrate, desecrate, gentle
      repose; 3rd-magic circle against evil/good/law, prayer; 4th-remove
      disease, speak with dead, sending; 5th-divination, restoration;
      6th-commune, hallow, unhallow, raise dead.

      The savage bard is a warrior at heart, though his arcane powers strike
      fear into the enemies of his tribe.  Savage bards often multi-class as
      barbarians to improve their combat prowess.
      
      *Alignment:*
      A savage bard must be chaotic in alignment. A savage bard who becomes
      nonchaotic cannot progress in levels as a bard, though he retains all
      his bard abilities.
      
      *Base Save Bonuses:*
      A savage bard has good Fortitude and Will saves, but has poor Reflex
      saves.
      
      *Class Skills:*
      A savage bard loses Decipher Script and Speak Language as class
      skills.  He adds Survival to his list of class skills.
      
      Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The savage bard has all the standard bard class features, except as
      noted below.
      
      *Illiteracy:*
      A savage bard is illiterate, just as a barbarian is. An illiterate
      savage bard cannot use or scribe scrolls.
      
      *Spellcasting:*
      Remove the following spells from the savage bard's class spell list:
      calm emotions, comprehend languages, detect secret doors, erase,
      prestidigitation, read magic, sepia snake sigil, summon monster (I
      through VI).
      
      Add the following spells to the savage bard's class spell list:
      1st-calm animals, detect snares and pits, endure elements, summon
      nature's ally I; 2nd-bull's strength, pass without trace, summon
      nature's ally II; 3rd-snare, summon nature's ally III; 4th-insect
      plague, summon nature's ally IV; 5th-commune with nature, summon
      nature's ally V; 6th-creeping doom, reincarnate, summon nature's ally
      VI.

      A rare bard might display a special link to nature and the mysterious
      world of the fey.  Such characters tend to be more aloof and less
      inspiring than standard bards.
      
      *Gain:*
      Animal companion (as druid), nature sense (as druid), resist nature's
      lure (as druid), wild empathy (as druid).
      
      *Lose:* Bardic knowledge, inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire
      greatness, inspire heroics.
