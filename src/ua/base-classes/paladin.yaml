      Paladin Variants: Freedom, Slaughter, And Tyranny
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      _Source: Unearthed Arcana_
      
      The three paladin variants presented here demonstrate examples of alternative-alignment paladins. Each one follows a specific code of conduct tailored to its specific alignment. The paladin of freedom is chaotic good, dedicated to liberty and free thought. The paladin of tyranny is the opposite, a lawful evil villain bent on dominating those weaker than she. The paladin of slaughter is a brutal champion of chaos and evil who leaves only destruction trailing in his wake. (If you use these versions of the paladin class, you might consider designating the standard paladin as the "paladin of honor" to differentiate it from the variants.)
      
      These paladin variants aren't meant to be unique classes in and of themselves, but rather alignment-based variations of the paladin. They have the same Hit Die, skill points per level, weapon and armor proficiencies, and spells per day as the standard paladin. Their class skill lists are nearly identical, with exceptions noted below. Their spellcasting functions identically to that of the standard paladin (though their spell lists are somewhat different). When a class feature has the same name as a paladin class feature, it functions the same as the one described for the standard paladin.

      Paladin of Freedom Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The paladin of freedom has all the standard paladin class features, except as noted below.
      
      Class Skills
      ++++++++++++
      Replace Diplomacy with Bluff on the class skill list.
      
      Aura of Resolve (Su)
      ++++++++++++++++++++
      Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin of freedom is immune to compulsion effects. Each ally within 10 feet of him gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability otherwise functions identically to the paladin's aura of courage class feature.
      
      Spellcasting
      ++++++++++++
      Remove the following spells from the paladin's spell list: death ward, discern lies, dispel chaos, magic circle against chaos, protection from chaos.
      
      Add the following spells to the paladin's spell list: 1st-protection from law; 3rd-magic circle against law; 4th-dispel law, freedom of movement.
      
      Code of Conduct
      +++++++++++++++
      A paladin of freedom must be of chaotic good alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin of freedom's code requires that he respect individual liberty, help those in need (provided they do not use the help for lawful or evil ends), and punish those who threaten or curtail personal liberty.
      
      Associates
      ++++++++++
      While he may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin of freedom will never knowingly associate with evil characters (except on some sort of undercover mission), nor will he continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code. A paladin of freedom may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic good.
      
      Paladin of Slaughter Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The paladin of slaughter has all the standard paladin class features, except as noted below.
      
      Class Skills
      ++++++++++++
      Replace Diplomacy with Intimidate on the class skill list.
      
      Aura of Evil (Ex)
      +++++++++++++++++
      The power of a paladin of slaughter's aura of evil (see the detect evil spell) is equal to her paladin of slaughter level, just as with the aura of a cleric of an evil deity.
      
      Detect Good (Sp)
      ++++++++++++++++
      At will, a paladin of slaughter can use detect good, as the spell.
      
      Smite Good (Su)
      +++++++++++++++
      Once per day, a paladin of slaughter may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. This ability is otherwise identical to the standard paladin's ability to smite evil, including increased daily uses as the paladin of slaughter gains class levels.
      
      Deadly Touch (Su)
      +++++++++++++++++
      Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin of slaughter can cause wounds with a successful touch attack. Each day she can deal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. An opponent subjected to this attack can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin level + paladin's Cha modifier) to halve the damage dealt.
      
      Alternatively, a paladin of slaughter can use any or all of this power to cure damage to undead creatures, just as an inflict wounds spell does. This power otherwise functions identically to the paladin's lay on hands ability.
      
      Debilitating Aura (Su)
      ++++++++++++++++++++++
      Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin of slaughter radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of her to take a -1 penalty to Armor Class. This ability otherwise functions identically to the paladin's aura of courage class feature.
      
      Rebuke Undead (Su)
      ++++++++++++++++++
      A paladin of slaughter rebukes undead rather than turning undead.
      
      Cause Disease (Sp)
      ++++++++++++++++++
      A paladin of slaughter can inflict disease with her touch (as the contagion spell) a number of times per week that a standard paladin of her level would normally be able to remove disease.
      
      Spellcasting
      ++++++++++++
      Replace the standard paladin's spell list with the following spell list: 1st-bane, cause fear, corrupt weapon, create water, curse water, detect poison, detect undead, divine favor, endure elements, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, protection from good, protection from law, read magic, resistance, virtue; 2nd-bull's strength, cure light wounds, darkness, delay poison, eagle's splendor, inflict moderate wounds, owl's wisdom, resist energy, undetectable alignment; 3rd-blindness/deafness, cure moderate wounds, deeper darkness, dispel magic, greater magic weapon, heal mount, prayer, inflict serious wounds, magic circle against good/law; 4th-break enchantment, cure serious wounds, dispel good, dispel law, inflict critical wounds, poison, unholy sword.
      
      Code of Conduct
      +++++++++++++++
      A paladin of slaughter must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits a good act. Additionally, a paladin of slaughter's code requires that she disrespect all authority figures who have not proven their physical superiority to her, refuse help to those in need, and sow destruction and death at all opportunities.
      
      Associates
      ++++++++++
      While she may adventure with characters of any evil or neutral alignment, a paladin of slaughter will never knowingly associate with good characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin of tyranny may accept only henchmen, followers, and cohorts who are chaotic evil.
      
      Paladin of Tyranny Class Features

      The paladin of tyranny has all the standard paladin class features, except as noted below.
      
      Aura of Evil (Ex)
      +++++++++++++++++
      The power of a paladin of tyranny's aura of evil (see the detect evil spell) is equal to his paladin of tyranny level, just as with the aura of a cleric of an evil deity.
      
      Detect Good (Sp)
      ++++++++++++++++
      At will, a paladin of tyranny can use detect good, as the spell.
      
      Smite Good (Su)
      +++++++++++++++

      Deadly Touch (Su)
      +++++++++++++++++
      Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin of tyranny can cause wounds with a successful touch attack. Each day she can deal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus.

      Alternatively, a paladin of tyranny can use any or all of this power to cure damage to undead creatures, just as an inflict wounds spell does. This power otherwise functions identically to the paladin's lay on hands ability.
      
      Aura of Despair (Su)
      ++++++++++++++++++++
      Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin of tyranny radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This ability otherwise functions identically to the paladin's aura of courage class feature.
      
      Rebuke Undead (Su)
      ++++++++++++++++++
      A paladin of tyranny rebukes undead rather than turning undead.
      
      Cause Disease (Sp)

      ++++++++++++
      Replace the paladin's spell list with the following spell list: 1st-bane, corrupt weapon, create water, curse water, detect poison, detect undead, divine favor, doom, endure elements, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, protection from chaos, protection from good, read magic, resistance, virtue; 2nd-bull's strength, cure light wounds, darkness, delay poison, eagle's splendor, hold person, inflict moderate wounds, owl's wisdom, resist energy, undetectable alignment; 3rd-bestow curse, cure moderate wounds, deeper darkness, discern lies, dispel magic, greater magic weapon, heal mount, prayer, inflict serious wounds, magic circle against chaos/good; 4th-break enchantment, cure serious wounds, dispel chaos, dispel good, dominate person, inflict critical wounds, unholy sword.
      
      Code of conduct
      +++++++++++++++
      A paladin of tyranny must be of lawful evil alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits a good act. Additionally, a paladin of tyranny's code requires that he respect authority figures as long as they have the strength to rule over the weak, act with discipline (not engaging in random slaughter, keeping firm control over those beneath his station, and so forth), help only those who help him maintain or improve his status, and punish those who challenge authority (unless, of course, such challengers prove more worthy to hold that authority).
      
      Associates
      ++++++++++
      While he may adventure with characters of any evil or neutral alignment, a paladin of tyranny will never knowingly associate with good characters unless it serves his needs, nor will he continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code. A paladin of tyranny may accept henchmen and followers of any alignment, but may only accept cohorts who are lawful evil.
