Class Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All of the following are class features of the barbarian.

*Weapon and Armor Proficiency:* A barbarian is proficient with all simple and
martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower
shields).

indexterm:[Class Features,Fast Movement]
*Fast Movement (Ex):* A barbarian’s land speed is faster than the norm for his
race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor,
light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus
before modifying the barbarian’s speed because of any load carried or armor
worn.

indexterm:[Class Features,Illiteracy]
*Illiteracy:* Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know
how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the
ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak.
A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains
literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the
literacy he or she already had.

indexterm:[Class Features,Rage]
*Rage (Ex):* A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per
day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4
bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a
-2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the
barbarian’s hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away
at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal.
(These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points
are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or
Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate,
and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience
or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that
require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell
completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except
Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage
lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character’s (newly improved)
Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end
of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and
becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can’t
charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a
17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see
below).

A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can
use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels
thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six
times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a
barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone
else’s action.

indexterm:[Class Features,Uncanny Dodge]
*Uncanny Dodge (Ex):* At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to
AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible
attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.
If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he
automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

indexterm:[Class Features,Trap Sense]
*Trap Sense (Ex):* Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on
Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks
made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels
thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained
from multiple classes stack.

indexterm:[Class Features,Improved Uncanny Dodge]
*Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):* At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no
longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack
the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more
rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a character already
has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character
automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the
classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a
rogue must be to flank the character.

indexterm:[Class Features,Damage Reduction]
*Damage Reduction (Ex):* At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction.

Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage
from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian
levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises
by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

indexterm:[Class Features,Greater Rage]
*Greater Rage (Ex):* At 11th level, a barbarian’s bonuses to Strength and
Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on
Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.

indexterm:[Class Features,Indomitable Will]
*Indomitable Will (Ex):* While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher
gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus
stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he
also receives during his rage.

indexterm:[Class Features,Tireless Rage]
*Tireless Rage (Ex):* At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes
fatigued at the end of his rage.

indexterm:[Class Features,Mighty Rage]
*Mighty Rage (Ex):* At 20th level, a barbarian’s bonuses to Strength and
Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on
Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2.

Ex-Barbarians
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain
more levels as a barbarian. He retains all the other benefits of the class
(damage reduction, fast movement, trap sense, and uncanny dodge).
