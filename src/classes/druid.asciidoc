Class Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All of the following are class features of the druid.

*Weapon and Armor Proficiency:* Druids are proficient with the following
weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear,
sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw,
bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).
Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from
wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide
armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the
ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the
ironwood spell description) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower
shields) but must use only wooden ones.

A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable
to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class
abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

*Spells:* A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell
list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to
her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells,
below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).
To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at
least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against
a druid’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid’s Wisdom modifier.
Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of
each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table:
The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high
Wisdom score. She does not have access to any domain spells or granted
powers, as a cleric does.

A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot
lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place (but see Spontaneous
Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell
list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose
which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

*Spontaneous Casting:* A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning
spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared
spell in order to cast any summon nature’s ally spell of the same level or
lower. 

*Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:* A druid can’t cast spells of
an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells
associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil,
good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

*Bonus Languages:* A druid’s bonus language options include Sylvan, the
language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus
languages available to the character because of her race.

A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which
she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a
druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of
languages and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to
teach this language to nondruids.

Druidic has its own alphabet.

*Animal Companion (Ex):* A druid may begin play with an animal companion
selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog,
eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium
viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic
environment, the following creatures are also available: crocodile,
porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that
accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.

A 1st-level druid’s companion is completely typical for its kind except as
noted below. As a druid advances in level, the animal’s power increases as
shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may
gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of
prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has
perished.

A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals
(see below). Should she select an animal companion from one of these
alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character’s druid
level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the
appropriate list header from the character’s druid level and compare the
result with the druid level entry on the table to determine the animal
companion’s powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid’s effective
level to 0 or lower, she can’t have that animal as a companion.) 

*Nature Sense (Ex):* A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and
Survival checks.

*Wild Empathy (Ex):* A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This
ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude
of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma
modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while
wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each
other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under
normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1
minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an
Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.
Woodland Stride (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any
sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and
similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering
any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have
been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.

*Trackless Step (Ex):* Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in
natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail
if so desired.

*Resist Nature’s Lure (Ex):* Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus
on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

*Wild Shape (Su):* At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself
into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for
new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions
like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour
per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or
back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity.

The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with. 

A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is
limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can
communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her
new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to
this form does not permit speech.)

A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and
18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid. In addition, she gains the ability
to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th
level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.

The new form’s Hit Dice can’t exceed the character’s druid level.

At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant
creature with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can’t
use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn’t a creature.)

At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a
Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day.
These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In
addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the
elemental’s extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also
gains the elemental’s feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but
she retains her own creature type.

At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day,
and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid
may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.

*Venom Immunity (Ex):* At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons. 

*A Thousand Faces (Su):* At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change
her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in
her normal form.

*Timeless Body (Ex):* After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes
ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any
penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.
Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is
up.

Ex-Druids
^^^^^^^^^

A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or
teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid
abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor,
and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid
until she atones (see the atonement spell description).
