Prestige Classes
================

Prestige Class Overview
-----------------------

Prestige classes offer a new form of multiclassing. Unlike the basic
classes, characters must meet Requirements before they can take their first
level of a prestige class. The rules for level advancement apply to this
system, meaning the first step of advancement is always choosing a class. If
a character does not meet the Requirements for a prestige class before that
first step, that character cannot take the first level of that prestige
class.  Taking a prestige class does not incur the experience point
penalties normally associated with multiclassing.
