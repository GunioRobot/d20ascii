Feats
-----

PREREQUISITES
Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.
A character can’t use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.

TYPES OF FEATS
Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are item creation feats, which allow spellcasters to create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were a higher spell level than it actually is.

FIGHTER BONUS FEATS
Any feat designated as a fighter feat can be selected as a fighter’s bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming that they meet any prerequisites.

ITEM CREATION FEATS
An item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.
XP Cost: Experience that the spellcaster would normally keep is expended when making a magic item. The XP cost equals 1/25 of the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.
Raw Materials Cost: The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item.
Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.
Time: The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.
Item Cost: Brew Potion, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their caster level—that is, a spell from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be high enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:
Scrolls: Base price = spell level x caster level x 25 gp.
Potions: Base price = spell level x caster level x 50 gp.
Wands: Base price = spell level x caster level x 750 gp.
A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.
Extra Costs: Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component or pay the XP cost when creating the item.
For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.
Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions.

METAMAGIC FEATS
As a spellcaster’s knowledge of magic grows, she can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the ways in which the spells were originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, at least it is possible.  Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up.
Wizards and Divine Spellcasters: Wizards and divine spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation, the character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).
Sorcerers and Bards: Sorcerers and bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. But because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell’s normal casting time is 1 action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn’t the same as a 1-round casting time.)
For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.
Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats: A cleric spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a 1-action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast.
Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell: In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast as a higher-level spell. Saving throw modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.
The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can’t use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.
Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don’t eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. However, casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can’t modify.

Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell: A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can’t apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.

Magic Items and Metamagic Spells: With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell’s higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn’t need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.
Counterspelling Metamagic Spells: Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell.

FEAT DESCRIPTIONS
Here is the format for feat descriptions.

FEAT NAME [TYPE OF FEAT]
Prerequisite: A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or a class level that a character must have in order to acquire this feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have more than one prerequisite.
Benefit: What the feat enables the character (“you” in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.
In general, having a feat twice is the same as having it once.
Normal: What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.
Special: Additional facts about the feat that may be helpful when you decide whether to acquire the feat.

An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don’t lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn’t get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker’s bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.
You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces your speed to three-quarters normal, instead of one-half.

BREW POTION [ITEM CREATION]
Prerequisite: Caster level 3rd.
Benefit: You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion takes one day. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its spell level x its caster level x 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price.
When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.
Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.

CLEAVE [GENERAL]

To enhance a weapon, suit of armor, or shield, you must spend 1/25 of its features’ total price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this total price.
The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost.

A fighter may select Deflect Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats.

DEFT HANDS [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Sleight of Hand checks and Use Rope checks.

DIEHARD [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Endurance.
Benefit: When reduced to between –1 and –9 hit points, you automatically become stable. You don’t have to roll d% to see if you lose 1 hit point each round.
When reduced to negative hit points, you may choose to act as if you were disabled, rather than dying. You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn’t your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.
When using this feat, you can take either a single move or standard action each turn, but not both, and you cannot take a full round action. You can take a move action without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action (or any other action deemed as strenuous, including some free actions, such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. If you reach –10 hit points, you immediately die.

Prerequisite: Dex 13.
Benefit: During your action, you designate an opponent and receive a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks from that opponent. You can select a new opponent on any action.
A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses. Also, dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most other types of bonuses.
Special: A fighter may select Dodge as one of his fighter bonus feats.

EMPOWER SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Benefit: All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by one-half.
Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. An empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level.

An enlarged spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.
Spells whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as spells whose ranges are not close, medium, or long, do not have increased ranges.

ESCHEW MATERIALS [GENERAL]
Benefit: You can cast any spell that has a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. (The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.) If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have the material component at hand to cast the spell, just as normal.

EXOTIC WEAPON PROFICIENCY [GENERAL]
Choose a type of exotic weapon. You understand how to use that type of exotic weapon in combat.

A fighter may select Exotic Weapon Proficiency as one of his fighter bonus feats.

EXTEND SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Benefit: An extended spell lasts twice as long as normal. A spell with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent is not affected by this feat. An extended spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.

EXTRA TURNING [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Ability to turn or rebuke creatures.
Benefit: Each time you take this feat, you can use your ability to turn or rebuke creatures four more times per day than normal.

Special: A fighter may select Far Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.

FORGE RING [ITEM CREATION]
Prerequisite: Caster level 12th.
Benefit: You can create any ring whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a ring takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a ring, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price.
You can also mend a broken ring if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to forge that ring in the first place.
Some magic rings incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. You must pay such a cost to forge such a ring or to mend a broken one.

HEIGHTEN SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Benefit: A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a maximum of 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs and ability to penetrate a lesser globe of invulnerability) are calculated according to the heightened level. The heightened spell is as difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level.

IMPROVED BULL RUSH [GENERAL]

A monk may select Improved Disarm as a bonus feat at 6th level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

IMPROVED FAMILIAR [GENERAL]
This feat allows spellcasters to acquire a new familiar from a nonstandard list, but only when they could normally acquire a new familiar.
Prerequisites: Ability to acquire a new familiar, compatible alignment, sufficiently high level (see below).
Benefit: When choosing a familiar, the creatures listed below are also available to the spellcaster. The spellcaster may choose a familiar with an alignment up to one step away on each of the alignment axes (lawful through chaotic, good through evil).

Familiar
Alignment
Arcane Spellcaster Level
Shocker lizard

Formian worker
Lawful neutral
7th

Improved familiars otherwise use the rules for regular familiars, with two exceptions: If the creature’s type is something other than animal, its type does not change; and improved familiars do not gain the ability to speak with other creatures of their kind (although many of them already have the ability to communicate).

The list in the table above presents only a few possible improved familiars. Almost any creature of the same general size and power as those on the list makes a suitable familiar. Nor is the master’s alignment the only possible categorization. For instance, improved familiars could be assigned by the master’s creature type or subtype, as shown below.

IMPROVED PRECISE SHOT [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 19, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack bonus +11.
Benefit: Your ranged attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by anything less than total cover, and the miss chance granted to targets by anything less than total concealment. Total cover and total concealment provide their normal benefits against your ranged attacks.
In addition, when you shoot or throw ranged weapons at a grappling opponent, you automatically strike at the opponent you have chosen.

IMPROVED SHIELD BASH [GENERAL]

Special: A fighter may select Improved Sunder as one of his fighter bonus feats.

IMPROVED TRIP [GENERAL]

If you trip an opponent in melee combat, you immediately get a melee attack against that opponent as if you hadn’t used your attack for the trip attempt.
Normal: Without this feat, you provoke an attack of opportunity when you attempt to trip an opponent while you are unarmed.
Special: At 6th level, a monk may select Improved Trip as a bonus feat, even if she does not have the prerequisites.
A fighter may select Improved Trip as one of his fighter bonus feats.

IMPROVED TURNING [GENERAL]

IMPROVED UNARMED STRIKE [GENERAL]
Benefit: You are considered to be armed even when unarmed —that is, you do not provoke attacks or opportunity from armed opponents when you attack them while unarmed. However, you still get an attack of opportunity against any opponent who makes an unarmed attack on you.
In addition, your unarmed strikes can deal lethal or nonlethal damage, at your option.
Normal: Without this feat, you are considered unarmed when attacking with an unarmed strike, and you can deal only nonlethal damage with such an attack.
Special: A monk automatically gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat at 1st level. She need not select it.
A fighter may select Improved Unarmed Strike as one of his fighter bonus feats.

INVESTIGATOR [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Gather Information checks and Search checks.

IRON WILL [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Will saving throws.

LEADERSHIP [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Character level 6th.
Benefits: Having this feat enables the character to attract loyal companions and devoted followers, subordinates who assist her. See the table below for what sort of cohort and how many followers the character can recruit.
Leadership Modifiers: Several factors can affect a character’s Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base score (character level + Cha modifier). A character’s reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower he is trying to attract) raises or lowers his Leadership score:

Leader’s Reputation
Modifier
Great renown
+2
Fairness and generosity
+1
Special power
+1
Failure
–1
Aloofness
–1
Cruelty
–2

Other modifiers may apply when the character tries to attract a cohort:
The Leader . . .
Modifier
Has a familiar, special mount, or animal companion
–2
Recruits a cohort of a different alignment
–1
Caused the death of a cohort
–2*
* Cumulative per cohort killed.

Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When the character tries to attract a new follower, use any of the following modifiers that apply.
The Leader . . .
Modifier
Has a stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, or the like
+2
Moves around a lot
–1
Caused the death of other followers
–1.

Leadership Score: A character’s base Leadership score equals his level plus any Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but the character must still be 6th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect a character’s Leadership score, as detailed above.
Cohort Level: The character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of a character’s Leadership score, he can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and alignment. The cohort’s alignment may not be opposed to the leader’s alignment on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the leader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an alignment different from his own.
Cohorts earn XP as follows:
The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party’s XP.
Divide the cohort’s level by the level of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the Leadership feat who attracted the cohort).
Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the cohort’s total.
If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than the associated PC’s character level, the cohort does not gain the new level—its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next level.

Number of Followers by Level: The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they’re generally low-level NPCs. Because they’re generally five or more levels behind the character they follow, they’re rarely effective in combat.
Followers don’t earn experience and thus don’t gain levels. However, when a character with Leadership attains a new level, the player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more followers, some of which may be higher level than the existing followers. (You don’t consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)

LIGHTNING REFLEXES [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws.

MAGICAL APTITUDE [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Spellcraft checks and Use Magic Device checks.

MANYSHOT [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 17, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6
Benefit: As a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows use the same attack roll (with a –4 penalty) to determine success and deal damage normally (but see Special).
For every five points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you may add one additional arrow to this attack, to a maximum of four arrows at a base attack bonus of +16. However, each arrow after the second adds a cumulative –2 penalty on the attack roll (for a total penalty of –6 for three arrows and –8 for four).
Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.
Special: Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If you score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular damage.
A fighter may select Manyshot as one of his fighter bonus feats.
A 6th-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Manyshot even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.

MARTIAL WEAPON PROFICIENCY [GENERAL]
Choose a type of martial weapon. You understand how to use that type of martial weapon in combat.
Benefit: You make attack rolls with the selected weapon normally.
Normal: When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls.
Special: Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all martial weapons. They need not select this feat.
You can gain Martial Weapon Proficiency multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.
A cleric who chooses the War domain automatically gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat related to his deity’s favored weapon as a bonus feat, if the weapon is a martial one. He need not select it.

MAXIMIZE SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Benefit: All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell’s actual level.
An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.

MOBILITY [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 13, Dodge.
Benefit: You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
Dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.
Special: A fighter may select Mobility as one of his fighter bonus feats.

MOUNTED ARCHERY [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.
Benefit: The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon while mounted is halved: –2 instead of –4 if your mount is taking a double move, and –4 instead of –8 if your mount is running.
Special: A fighter may select Mounted Archery as one of his fighter bonus feats.

MOUNTED COMBAT [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Ride 1 rank.
Benefit: Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent’s attack roll. (Essentially, the Ride check result becomes the mount’s Armor Class if it’s higher than the mount’s regular AC.)
Special: A fighter may select Mounted Combat as one of his fighter bonus feats.

NATURAL SPELL [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Wis 13, wild shape ability.
Benefit: You can complete the verbal and somatic components of spells while in a wild shape. You substitute various noises and gestures for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell.
You can also use any material components or focuses you possess, even if such items are melded within your current form. This feat does not permit the use of magic items while you are in a form that could not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak while in a wild shape.

NEGOTIATOR [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy checks and Sense Motive checks.

NIMBLE FINGERS [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Disable Device checks and Open Lock checks.

PERSUASIVE [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Bluff checks and Intimidate checks.

POINT BLANK SHOT [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.
Special: A fighter may select Point Blank Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.

POWER ATTACK [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Str 13.
Benefit: On your action, before making attack rolls for a round, you may choose to subtract a number from all melee attack rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply until your next turn.
Special: If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands, instead add twice the number subtracted from your attack rolls. You can’t add the bonus from Power Attack to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the penalty on attack rolls still applies. (Normally, you treat a double weapon as a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.)
A fighter may select Power Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.

PRECISE SHOT [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot.
Benefit: You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard –4 penalty on your attack roll.
Special: A fighter may select Precise Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.

QUICK DRAW [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.
Benefit: You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the Sleight of Hand skill) as a move action.
A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).
Normal: Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.
Special: A fighter may select Quick Draw as one of his fighter bonus feats.

QUICKEN SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Benefit: Casting a quickened spell is a free action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. You may cast only one quickened spell per round. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 full round action cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell’s actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity.
Special: This feat can’t be applied to any spell cast spontaneously (including sorcerer spells, bard spells, and cleric or druid spells cast spontaneously), since applying a metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast spell automatically increases the casting time to a full-round action.

RAPID RELOAD [GENERAL]
Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy).
Prerequisite: Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).
Benefit: The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.
If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.
Normal: A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow.
Special: You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.
A fighter may select Rapid Reload as one of his fighter bonus feats.

RAPID SHOT [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 13, Point Blank Shot.
Benefit: You can get one extra attack per round with a ranged weapon. The attack is at your highest base attack bonus, but each attack you make in that round (the extra one and the normal ones) takes a –2 penalty. You must use the full attack action to use this feat.
Special: A fighter may select Rapid Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.
A 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Rapid Shot, even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.

RIDE-BY ATTACK [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.
Benefit: When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack as if with a standard charge and then move again (continuing the straight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round can’t exceed double your mounted speed. You and your mount do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the opponent that you attack.
Special: A fighter may select Ride-By Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.

RUN [GENERAL]
Benefit: When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make a jump after a running start (see the Jump skill description), you gain a +4 bonus on your Jump check. While running, you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC.
Normal: You move four times your speed while running (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or three times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load), and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.

SCRIBE SCROLL [ITEM CREATION]
Prerequisite: Caster level 1st.
Benefit: You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a scroll is its spell level x its caster level x 25 gp. To scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.
Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when scribing the scroll.

SELF-SUFFICIENT [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Heal checks and Survival checks.

SHIELD PROFICIENCY [GENERAL]
Benefit: You can use a shield and take only the standard penalties.
Normal: When you are using a shield with which you are not proficient, you take the shield’s armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all skill checks that involve moving, including Ride checks.
Special: Barbarians, bards, clerics, druids, fighters, paladins, and rangers automatically have Shield Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.

SHOT ON THE RUN [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, base attack bonus +4.
Benefit: When using the attack action with a ranged weapon, you can move both before and after the attack, provided that your total distance moved is not greater than your speed.
Special: A fighter may select Shot on the Run as one of his fighter bonus feats.

SILENT SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Benefit: A silent spell can be cast with no verbal components. Spells without verbal components are not affected. A silent spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.
Special: Bard spells cannot be enhanced by this metamagic feat.

SIMPLE WEAPON PROFICIENCY [GENERAL]
Benefit: You make attack rolls with simple weapons normally.
Normal: When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls.
Special: All characters except for druids, monks, and wizards are automatically proficient with all simple weapons. They need not select this feat.

SKILL FOCUS [GENERAL]
Choose a skill.
Benefit: You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving that skill.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new skill.

SNATCH ARROWS [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 15, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike.
Benefit: When using the Deflect Arrows feat you may catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons can immediately be thrown back at the original attacker (even though it isn’t your turn) or kept for later use.
You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.
Special: A fighter may select Snatch Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats.

SPELL FOCUS [GENERAL]
Choose a school of magic.
Benefit: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you select.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school of magic.

SPELL MASTERY [SPECIAL]
Prerequisite: Wizard level 1st.
Benefit: Each time you take this feat, choose a number of spells equal to your Intelligence modifier that you already know. From that point on, you can prepare these spells without referring to a spellbook.
Normal: Without this feat, you must use a spellbook to prepare all your spells, except read magic.

SPELL PENETRATION [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on caster level checks (1d20 + caster level) made to overcome a creature’s spell resistance.

SPIRITED CHARGE [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack.
Benefit: When mounted and using the charge action, you deal double damage with a melee weapon (or triple damage with a lance).
Special: A fighter may select Spirited Charge as one of his fighter bonus feats.

SPRING ATTACK [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, base attack bonus +4.
Benefit: When using the attack action with a melee weapon, you can move both before and after the attack, provided that your total distance moved is not greater than your speed. Moving in this way does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender you attack, though it might provoke attacks of opportunity from other creatures, if appropriate. You can’t use this feat if you are wearing heavy armor.
You must move at least 5 feet both before and after you make your attack in order to utilize the benefits of Spring Attack.
Special: A fighter may select Spring Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.

STEALTHY [GENERAL]
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Hide checks and Move Silently checks.

STILL SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Benefit: A stilled spell can be cast with no somatic components.
Spells without somatic components are not affected. A stilled spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.

STUNNING FIST [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.
Benefit: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next action). A stunned character can’t act, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a –2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be stunned.
Special: A monk may select Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. A monk who selects this feat may attempt a stunning attack a number of times per day equal to her monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels she has in classes other than monk.
A fighter may select Stunning Fist as one of his fighter bonus feats.

TOUGHNESS [GENERAL]
Benefit: You gain +3 hit points.
Special: A character may gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.

TOWER SHIELD PROFICIENCY [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Shield Proficiency.
Benefit: You can use a tower shield and suffer only the standard penalties.
Normal: A character who is using a shield with which he or she is not proficient takes the shield’s armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all skill checks that involve moving, including Ride.
Special: Fighters automatically have Tower Shield Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.

TRACK [GENERAL]
Benefit: To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow.
You move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed with a –5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a –20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions, as given on the table below:

Surface
Survival DC
Surface Survival
DC
Very soft ground
5
Firm ground
15
Soft ground
10
Hard ground
20

Very Soft Ground: Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.
Soft Ground: Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.
Firm Ground: Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.
Hard Ground: Any surface that doesn’t hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles).
Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the table below.

2 Apply only the largest modifier from this category.

If you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.
Normal: Without this feat, you can use the Survival skill to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use the Search skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature’s passage using the DCs given above, but you can’t use Search to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them.
Special: A ranger automatically has Track as a bonus feat. He need not select it.
This feat does not allow you to find or follow the tracks made by a subject of a pass without trace spell.

TRAMPLE [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.
Benefit: When you attempt to overrun an opponent while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you. Your mount may make one hoof attack against any target you knock down, gaining the standard +4 bonus on attack rolls against prone targets.
Special: A fighter may select Trample as one of his fighter bonus feats.

TWO-WEAPON DEFENSE [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 15, Two-Weapon Fighting.
Benefit: When wielding a double weapon or two weapons (not including natural weapons or unarmed strikes), you gain a +1 shield bonus to your AC.
When you are fighting defensively or using the total defense action, this shield bonus increases to +2.
Special: A fighter may select Two-Weapon Defense as one of his fighter bonus feats.

TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING [GENERAL]
You can fight with a weapon in each hand. You can make one extra attack each round with the second weapon.
Prerequisite: Dex 15.
Benefit: Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two weapons are reduced. The penalty for your primary hand lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6.
Normal: If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. When fighting in this way you suffer a –6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a –10 penalty to the attack with your off hand. If your off-hand weapon is light the penalties are reduced by 2 each. (An unarmed strike is always considered light.)
Special: A 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the two-weapon combat style is treated as having Two-Weapon Fighting, even if he does not have the prerequisite for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.
A fighter may select Two-Weapon Fighting as one of his fighter bonus feats.

WEAPON FINESSE [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.
Benefit: With a light weapon, rapier, whip, or spiked chain made for a creature of your size category, you may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a shield, its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.
Special: A fighter may select Weapon Finesse as one of his fighter bonus feats.
Natural weapons are always considered light weapons.

WEAPON FOCUS [GENERAL]
Choose one type of weapon. You can also choose unarmed strike or grapple (or ray, if you are a spellcaster) as your weapon for purposes of this feat.
 Prerequisites: Proficiency with selected weapon, base attack bonus +1.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using the selected weapon.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.
A fighter may select Weapon Focus as one of his fighter bonus feats. He must have Weapon Focus with a weapon to gain the Weapon Specialization feat for that weapon.

WEAPON SPECIALIZATION [GENERAL]
Choose one type of weapon for which you have already selected the Weapon Focus feat. You can also choose unarmed strike or grapple as your weapon for purposes of this feat. You deal extra damage when using this weapon.
 Prerequisites: Proficiency with selected weapon, Weapon Focus with selected weapon, fighter level 4th.
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on all damage rolls you make using the selected weapon.

A fighter may select Weapon Specialization as one of his fighter bonus feats.

WHIRLWIND ATTACK [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 13, Int 13, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, base attack bonus +4.
Benefit: When you use the full attack action, you can give up your regular attacks and instead make one melee attack at your full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach.
When you use the Whirlwind Attack feat, you also forfeit any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities.
Special: A fighter may select Whirlwind Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.

WIDEN SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Benefit: You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread shaped spell to increase its area. Any numeric measurements of the spell’s area increase by 100%.A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell’s actual level.
Spells that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.

Psionic Feats
-------------


Psionic feats are available only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest powers. (In other words, they either have a power point reserve or have psi-like abilities.)
Because psionic feats are supernatural abilities—a departure from the general rule that feats do not grant supernatural abilities—they cannot be disrupted in combat (as powers can be) and generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power resistance and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is suppressed, such as a null psionics field. Leaving such an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.
Many psionic feats can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to expend your psionic focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus does not require an action; it is part of another action (such as using a feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for which you expended it.

PSIONIC ITEM CREATION FEATS
Manifesters can use their personal power to create lasting psionic items. Doing so, however, is draining. A manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.
A psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.
XP Cost: Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.
Raw Materials Cost: Creating a psionic item requires costly components, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.
Using a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools, and other equipment. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such as if he’s traveling far from home).
Time: The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.
Item Cost: Craft Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe Tattoo create items that directly reproduce the effects of powers, and the strength of these items depends on their manifester level—that is, a power from such an item has the strength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that level. Often, that is the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item, the item’s strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item using a power augmented by spending additional power points, the character’s effective manifester level for the purpose of calculating the item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional power points are spent.) All other level-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according to the effective manifester level.
The price of psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on the level of the power and a character’s manifester level. The character’s manifester level must be high enough that the item creator can manifest the power at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s manifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.
Power Stones: Base price = power level x manifester level x 25 gp
Psionic Tattoos: Base price = power level x manifester level x 50 gp
Dorjes: Base price = power level x manifester level x 750 gp
Extra Costs: Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.
For psionic tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item. For a dorje, the creator must pay fifty times the XP cost.
Some psionic items similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.

METAPSIONIC FEATS
As a manifester’s knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways slightly different from how the powers were originally designed or learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is more expensive than manifesting the power normally.
Manifesting Time: Powers manifested using metapsionic feats take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat description specifically says otherwise.
Manifestation Cost: To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic character must both expend his psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description) and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat description.
Limits on Use: As with all powers, you cannot spend more power points on a power than your manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this rule.
Effects of Metapsionic Feats on a Power: In all ways, a metapsionic power operates at its original power level, even though it costs additional power points. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can’t use a metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or other device.
Manifesting a power modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Some metapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.
Psionic Items and Metapsionic Powers: With the right psionic item creation feat, you can store a metapsionic power in a power stone, psionic tattoo, or dorje. Level limits for psionic tattoos apply to the power’s higher metapsionic level.
A character doesn’t need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a metapsionic power is stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such an item.

FEAT DESCRIPTIONS
These feat descriptions follow the standard format.

ALIGNED ATTACK [PSIONIC]
Your melee or ranged attack overcomes your opponent’s alignment-based damage reduction and deals additional damage.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +6.
Benefit: When you take this feat, choose either chaos, good, evil or law. (Your choice must match one of your alignment components. Once you’ve made this alignment choice, it cannot be changed.
To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When you make a successful melee or ranged attack, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage, and your attack is treated as either a good, evil, chaotic, or lawful attack (depending on your original choice) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

ANTIPSIONIC MAGIC [GENERAL]
Your spells are more potent when used against psionic characters and creatures.
Prerequisite: Spellcraft 5 ranks.
Benefit: You get a get a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome a psionic creature’s power resistance.
This bonus stacks with the bonus conferred by Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration. Moreover, whenever a psionic creature attempts to dispel a spell you cast, it makes its manifester level check against a DC of 13 + its manifester level.
The benefits of this feat apply only to power resistance.
The bonus does not apply to spell resistance. This is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.
Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).

AUTONOMOUS [GENERAL]
You have a knack for psionic self-sufficiency.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Autohypnosis checks and Knowledge (psionics) checks.

BODY FUEL [PSIONIC]
You can expand your power point total at the expense of your health.
Benefit: You can recover 2 power points by taking 1 point of ability burn damage to each of your three ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.
You can recover additional power points for a proportional cost to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. These recovered points are added to your power point reserve as if you had gained them by resting overnight.
Special: Only living creatures can use this feat. You can take advantage of this feat only while in your own body.

BOOST CONSTRUCT [PSIONIC]
Your astral constructs have more abilities.
Benefit: When you create an astral construct, you can give it one additional special ability from any menu that the construct currently has an ability from.

BURROWING POWER [METAPSIONIC]
Your powers sometimes bypass barriers.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can attempt to manifest your powers against targets that are sheltered behind a wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the Astral Plane to bypass the barrier.
The strength and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully bypass the barrier with your power, you make a Psicraft check against a DC equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot of thickness (minimum 1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as force effects (or a wall of ectoplasm). Force walls or walls of ectoplasm are assumed to have less than 1 foot of thickness unless noted otherwise.
If a power requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or targets instead of an area), you cannot manifest it as a burrowing power unless you can somehow see the target, such as with clairvoyant sense. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

CHAIN POWER [METAPSIONIC]
You can manifest powers that arc to hit other targets in addition to the primary target.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can chain any power that affects a single target and that deals either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. After the primary target is struck, the power can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your manifester level (maximum twenty). The secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (round down).
Each target gets to make a saving throw, if one is allowed by the power. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example).
Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

CHAOTIC MIND [GENERAL]
The turbulence of your thoughts prevents others from gaining insight into your actions.
Prerequisite: Chaotic alignment, Cha 15.
Benefit: Creatures and characters who have an insight bonus on their attack rolls, an insight bonus to their Armor Class, or an insight bonus on skill checks or ability checks do not gain those bonuses against you.
The benefit of this feat applies only to insight bonuses gained from psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.
Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).

CLOAK DANCE [GENERAL]
You are skilled at using optical tricks to make yourself seem to be where you are not.
Prerequisites: Hide 10 ranks, Perform (dance) 2 ranks.
Benefit: You can take a move action to obscure your exact position. Until your next turn, you have concealment. Alternatively, you can take a full-round action to entirely obscure your exact position. Until your next action, you have total concealment.

Your mind is better able to resist psionics than normal.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all saving throws to resist powers.
The benefit of this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.
Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).

COMBAT MANIFESTATION [PSIONIC]
You are adept at manifesting powers in combat.
Benefit: You get a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to manifest a power or use a psi-like ability while on the defensive or while you are grappling or pinned.

CRAFT COGNIZANCE CRYSTAL [ITEM CREATION]
You can create psionic cognizance crystals that store power points.
Prerequisite: Manifester level 3rd.
Benefit: You can create a cognizance crystal. Doing so takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a cognizance crystal is equal to the highest-level power it could manifest using all its stored power points, squared, multiplied by 1,000 gp. To create a cognizance crystal, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half its base price.

CRAFT DORJE [ITEM CREATION]
You can create slender crystal wands called dorjes than manifest powers when charges are expended.
Prerequisite: Manifester level 5th.
Benefit: You can create a dorje of any psionic power you know (barring exceptions, such as bestow power, as noted in a power’s description). Crafting a dorje takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a dorje is its manifester level x the power level x 750 gp. To craft a dorje, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.
A newly created dorje has 50 charges.
Any dorje that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the XP cost derived from the base price, you must pay fifty times the XP cost.

To craft a psicrown, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price. Some psicrowns incur extra costs in XP as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the psicrown’s base price.

CRAFT PSIONIC ARMS AND ARMOR [ITEM CREATION]
You can create psionic weapons, armor, and shields.
Prerequisite: Manifester level 5th.
Benefit: You can create any psionic weapon, armor, or shield whose prerequisites you meet. Enhancing a weapon, suit of armor, or shield takes one day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its psionic features. To enhance a weapon, you must spend 1/25 of its features’ total price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this total price.
The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost.
You can also mend a broken psionic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to enhance that item in the first place.

CRAFT PSIONIC CONSTRUCT [ITEM CREATION]
You can create golems and other psionic automatons that obey your orders.
Prerequisites: Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, Craft Universal Item.
Benefit: You can create any psionic construct whose prerequisites you meet. Creating a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price.

A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit Dice.

CRAFT UNIVERSAL ITEM [ITEM CREATION]
You can create universal psionic items.
Prerequisite: Manifester level 3rd.
Benefit: You can create any universal psionic item whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a universal psionic item takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a universal psionic item, you must spend 1/25 of the item’s base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this price.
You can also mend a broken universal item if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place.
Some universal items incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the item’s base price. You must pay such a cost to create an item or to mend a broken one.

DEADLY PRECISION [GENERAL]
You empty your mind of all distracting emotion, becoming an instrument of deadly precision.
Prerequisite: Dex 15, base attack bonus +5.
Benefit: You have deadly accuracy with your sneak attacks. You can reroll any result of 1 on your sneak attack’s extra damage dice. You must keep the result of the reroll, even if it is another 1.

DEEP IMPACT [PSIONIC]
You can strike your foe with a melee weapon as if making a touch attack.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Psionic Weapon, base attack bonus +5.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can resolve your attack with a melee weapon as a touch attack. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

DELAY POWER [METAPSIONIC]
You can manifest powers that go off up to 5 rounds later.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can manifest a power as a delayed power. A delayed power doesn’t activate immediately. When you manifest the power, you choose one of three trigger mechanisms: (1) The power activates when you take a standard action to activate it; (2) It activates when a creature enters the area that the power will affect (only powers that affect areas can use this trigger condition); or (3) It activates on your turn after 5 rounds pass. If you choose one of the first two triggers and the conditions are not met within 5 rounds, the power activates automatically on the fifth round.
Only area and personal powers can be delayed.
Any decisions you would make about the delayed power, including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area, are decided when the power is manifested. Any effects resolved by those affected by the power, including saving throws, are decided when the delay period ends.
A delayed power can be dispelled normally during the delay, and can be detected normally in the area or on the target by the use of powers that can detect psionic effects.
Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

EMPOWER POWER [METAPSIONIC]
You can manifest powers to greater effect.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.
You can empower a power. All variable, numeric effects of an empowered power are increased by one-half. An empowered power deals half again as much damage as normal, cures half again as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, and so forth, as appropriate. Augmented powers can also be empowered (multiply 1-1/2 times the damage total of the augmented power). Saving throws and opposed checks (such as the one you make when you manifest dispel psionics) are not affected, nor are powers without random variables.
Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

ENLARGE POWER [METAPSIONIC]
You can manifest powers farther than normal.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can alter a power with a range of close, medium, or long to increase its range by 100%. An enlarged power with a range of close has a range of 50 feet + 5 feet per level, a medium-range power has a range of 200 feet + 20 feet per level, and a long-range power has a range of 800 feet + 80 feet per level.
Powers whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as powers whose ranges are not close, medium, or long, are
not affected.
Using this feat does not increase the power point cost of the power.

EXPANDED KNOWLEDGE [PSIONIC]
You learn another power.
Prerequisites: Manifester level 3rd.
Benefit: Add to your powers known one additional power of any level up to one level lower than the highest-level power you can manifest. You can choose any power, including powers from another discipline’s list or even from another class’s list.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you learn one new power at any level up to one less than the highest-level power you can manifest.

EXTEND POWER [METAPSIONIC]
You can manifest powers that last longer than normal.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.
You can manifest an extended power. An extended power lasts twice as long as normal. A power with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent is not affected by this feat.

FOCUSED SUNDER [PSIONIC]
You can sense the stress points on others’ weapons.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Power Attack, Improved Sunder.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.
When you strike at an opponent’s weapon, you ignore half of the weapon’s total hardness (round down). Total hardness includes any magical or psionic enhancements possessed by the weapon that increase its hardness.
Special: You can also sense the stress points in any hard construction, such as wooden doors or stone walls, and can ignore half of the object’s total hardness (round down) when attacking that object.

FORCE OF WILL [GENERAL]
You are able to resist psionic attacks with extreme force of will.
Prerequisite: Iron Will.
Benefit: Once per round, when targeted by a psionic effect that allows a Reflex save or a Fortitude save, you can instead make a Will saving throw to avoid the effect.
The benefit of this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.
Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).

GHOST ATTACK [PSIONIC]
Your deadly strikes against incorporeal foes always find their mark.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +3.
Benefit: You must be psionically focused to use this feat. When you make a melee attack or a ranged attack against an incorporeal creature, you can make two rolls to check for the miss chance. If either is successful, the attack is treated as if it were made with a ghost touch weapon for the purpose of affecting the creature. Your weapon or natural weapon actually appears to become briefly incorporeal as the attack is made.

GREATER MANYSHOT [GENERAL]
You are skilled at firing many arrows at once, even at different opponents.
Prerequisites: Dex 17, Manyshot, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6.
Benefit: When you use the Manyshot feat, you can fire each arrow at a different target instead of firing all of them at the same target. You make a separate attack roll for each arrow, regardless of whether you fire them at separate targets or the same target. Your precision-based damage applies to each arrow fired, and, if you score a critical hit with more than one of the arrows, each critical hit deals critical damage.
Special: A fighter may select this feat as one of his fighter bonus feats.

Benefit: When you use the Psionic Weapon feat, your attack with a melee weapon deals an extra 4d6 points of damage instead of an extra 2d6 points.

HOSTILE MIND [GENERAL]
Your mind recoils violently against those who use psionics against you.
Prerequisite: Cha 15.
Benefit: Whenever you are subject to a power from the telepathy discipline (regardless of whether the power is harmful or beneficial to you), the manifester must make a Will saving throw against a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma bonus or take 2d6 points of damage.
The benefit of this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.
Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).

IMPRINT STONE [ITEM CREATION]
You can create power stones to store psionic powers.
Prerequisite: Manifester level 1st.
Benefit: You can create a power stone of any power that you know. Encoding a power stone takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a power stone is the level of the stored power x its manifester level x 25 gp. To imprint a power stone, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.
Any power stone that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must pay the XP when encoding the stone.

IMPROVED PSICRYSTAL [PSIONIC]
You can upgrade your psicrystal.
Prerequisites: Psicrystal Affinity.
Benefit: You can implant another personality fragment in your psicrystal. You gain the benefits of both psicrystal personalities. Your psicrystal’s personality adjusts and becomes a blend between all implanted personality fragments. From now on, when determining the abilities of your psicrystal, treat your manifester level as one higher than your normal manifester level.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you implant a new personality fragment in your psicrystal, from which you derive the noted benefits, and you treat your level as one higher for the purpose of determining your psicrystal’s abilities.

INQUISITOR [PSIONIC]
You know when others lie.
Prerequisite: Wis 13.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.
You gain a +10 bonus on a Sense Motive check to oppose a Bluff check.

MAXIMIZE POWER [METAPSIONIC]
You can manifest powers to maximum effect.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.
You can maximize a power. All variable, numeric effects of a power modified by this feat are maximized. A maximized power deals maximum damage, cures the maximum number of hit points, affects the maximum number of targets, and so on, as appropriate. Saving throws and opposed checks are not affected, nor are powers without random variables.
Augmented powers can be maximized; a maximized augmented power deals the maximum damage (or cures the maximum hit points, and so on) of the augmented power.
An empowered and maximized power gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.
Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

MENTAL LEAP [PSIONIC]
You can make amazing jumps.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Jump 5 ranks.

The benefit of this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.
Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).

METAMORPHIC TRANSFER [PSIONIC]
You can gain a supernatural ability of a metamorphed form.
Prerequisite: Wis 13, manifester level 5th.
Benefit: Each time you change your form, such as through the metamorphosis power, you gain one of the new form’s supernatural abilities, if it has any.
You gain only three uses of the metamorphic ability per day, even if the creature into which you metamorph has a higher limit on uses (You are still subject to other restrictions on the use of the ability.) The save DC to resist a supernatural ability gained through Metamorphic Transfer (if it is an attack) is 10 + your Cha modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice.
Normal: You cannot use the supernatural abilities of creatures whose form you assume.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you can gain one additional supernatural ability.

MIND OVER BODY [GENERAL]
Your ability damage heals more rapidly.
Prerequisite: Con 13.
Benefit: You heal ability damage and ability burn damage more quickly than normal. You heal a number of ability points per day equal to 1 + your Constitution bonus.

NARROW MIND [PSIONIC]
Your ability to concentrate is as keen as an arrowhead, allowing you to gain your psionic focus even in the most turbulent situations.

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on Concentration checks you make to become psionically focused.

OPEN MINDED [GENERAL]
You are naturally able to reroute your memory, mind, and skill expertise.
Benefit: You immediately gain an extra 5 skill points. You spend these skill points as normal. If you spend them on a cross-class skills they count as 1/2 ranks. You cannot exceed the normal maximum ranks for your level in any skill.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you immediately gain another 5 skill points.

OPPORTUNITY POWER [METAPSIONIC]
You can make power-enhanced attacks of opportunity.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When you make an attack of opportunity, you can use any power you know with a range of touch, if you have at least one hand free.
Manifesting this power is an immediate action.
You cannot use this feat with a touch power whose manifesting time is longer than 1 full-round action.
Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Normal: Attacks of opportunity can be made only with melee weapons.

OVERCHANNEL [PSIONIC]
You burn your life force to strengthen your powers.
Benefit: While manifesting a power, you can increase your effective manifester level by one, but in so doing you take 1d8 points of damage. At 8th level, you can choose to increase your effective manifester level by two, but you take 3d8 points of damage. At 15th level, you can increase your effective manifester level by three, but you take 5d8 points of damage.
The effective increase in manifester level increases the number of power points you can expend on a single power manifestation, as well as increasing all manifester level-dependent effects, such as range, duration, and overcoming power resistance.
Normal: Your manifester level is equal to your total levels in classes that manifest powers.

POWER PENETRATION [PSIONIC]
Your powers are especially potent, breaking through power resistance more readily than normal.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You get a +4 bonus on manifester level checks made to overcome a creature’s power resistance.

POWER SPECIALIZATION [PSIONIC]
You deal more damage with your powers.
Prerequisites: Weapon Focus (ray), manifester level 4th.
Benefit: With rays and ranged touch attack powers that deal damage, you deal an extra 2 points of damage. If you expend your psionic focus when you manifest a ray or a ranged touch attack power that deals damage, you add your key ability bonus to the damage (instead of adding 2).

PSICRYSTAL AFFINITY [PSIONIC]
You have created a psicrystal.
Prerequisites: Manifester level 1st.
Benefit: This feat allows you to gain a psicrystal.

PSICRYSTAL CONTAINMENT [PSIONIC]
Your psicrystal has advanced enough that it can hold a psionic focus that you store within it.
Prerequisites: Psicrystal Affinity, manifester level 3rd.
Benefit: You can spend a full-round action attempting to psionically focus your psicrystal. At any time when you need to expend your psionic focus, you can expend your psicrystal’s psionic focus instead, as long as the crystal is within 5 feet of you. Psionically focusing your psicrystal works just like focusing yourself. The psicrystal cannot focus itself—only the owner can spend the time to focus the crystal.

PSIONIC AFFINITY [GENERAL]
You have a knack for psionic endeavors.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Psicraft checks and Use Psionic Device checks.

PSIONIC BODY [PSIONIC]
Your mind reinforces your body.
Benefit: When you take this feat, you gain 2 hit points for each psionic feat you have (including this one). Whenever you take a new psionic feat, you gain 2 more hit points.

PSIONIC CHARGE [PSIONIC]
You can charge in a crooked line.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Speed of Thought.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When you charge, you can make one turn of up to 90 degrees during your movement. All other restrictions on charges still apply; for instance, you cannot pass through a square that blocks or slows movement, or that contains a creature. You must have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn.

PSIONIC DODGE [PSIONIC]
You are proficient at dodging blows.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Dodge.
Benefit: You must be psionically focused to use this feat. You receive a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. This bonus stacks with the bonus from the Dodge feat (but only applies on attacks made by the opponent you have designated).

PSIONIC ENDOWMENT [PSIONIC]
You can endow your manifestations with more concentrated focus.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You add 1 to the save DC of a power you manifest.

PSIONIC FIST [PSIONIC]
You can charge your unarmed strike or natural weapon with additional damage potential.
Prerequisite: Str 13.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Your unarmed strike or attack with a natural weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage.
You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

PSIONIC HOLE [GENERAL]
You are anathema to psionic creatures and characters.
Prerequisite: Con 15.
Benefit: When a foe strikes you in melee combat, the foe immediately loses its psionic focus, if any. Also, if you are the target of a power, the manifester of the power must spend an additional number of power points equal to your Wisdom bonus, or the power fails (all the power points spent on the power are still lost). This extra cost does not count toward the maximum power points a manifester can spend on a single power.
Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).

PSIONIC MEDITATION [PSIONIC]
You can focus your mind faster than normal, even under duress.
Prerequisite: Wis 13, Concentration 7 ranks.
Benefit: You can take a move action to become psionically focused.
Normal: A character without this feat must take a full-round action to become psionically focused.

PSIONIC SHOT [PSIONIC]
You can charge your ranged attacks with additional damage potential.
Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Your ranged attack deals +2d6 points of damage. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

PSIONIC TALENT [PSIONIC]
You gain additional power points to supplement those you already had.
Prerequisite: Having a power point reserve.
Benefit: When you take this feat for the first time, you gain 2 power points.
Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat after the first time, the number of power points you gain increases by 1.

PSIONIC WEAPON [PSIONIC]
You can charge your melee weapon with additional damage potential.
Prerequisite: Str 13.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.
Your attack with a melee weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

QUICKEN POWER [METAPSIONIC]
You can manifest a power with a moment’s thought.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can quicken a power. You can perform another action, even manifest another power, in the same round that you manifest a quickened power. You can manifest only one quickened power per round. A power whose manifesting time is longer than 1 round cannot be quickened.
Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Manifesting a quickened power does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

RAPID METABOLISM [GENERAL]
Your wounds heal rapidly.
Prerequisite: Con 13.
Benefit: You naturally heal a number of hit points per day equal to the standard healing rate + double your Constitution  bonus. You heal even if you do not rest. This healing replaces your normal natural healing. If you are tended successfully by someone with the Heal skill, you instead regain double the normal amount of hit points + double your Constitution bonus.

RECKLESS OFFENSE [GENERAL]
You can shift your focus from defense to offense.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.
Benefit: When you use the attack action or full attack action in melee, you can take a penalty of –4 to your Armor Class and add a +2 bonus on your melee attack roll. The bonus on attack rolls and penalty to Armor Class last until the beginning of your next turn.

RETURN SHOT [PSIONIC]
You can return incoming arrows, as well as crossbow bolts, spears, and other projectile or thrown weapons.
Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot, Psionic Shot, Fell Shot, base attack bonus +3.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus and have at least one hand free. Once per round when you would normally be hit by a projectile or a thrown weapon no more than one size category larger than your size, you can deflect the attack so that you take no damage from it. The attack is deflected back at your attacker, using the attack bonus of the original attack on you. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to return a shot is a free action.
Special: If you also have the Deflect Arrows feat, the deflected attack is made with the original attack bonus plus your Dexterity bonus.

SCRIBE TATTOO [ITEM CREATION]
You can create psionic tattoos, which store powers within their designs.
Prerequisite: Manifester level 3rd.
Benefit: You can create a psionic tattoo of any power of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Scribing a psionic tattoo takes one day. When you create a psionic tattoo, you set the manifester level. The manifester level must be sufficient to manifest the power in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a psionic tattoo is its power level x its manifester level x 50 gp. To scribe a tattoo, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (special inks, masterwork needles, and so on) costing one-half of this base price.
When you create a psionic tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when manifesting the power.
When its wearer physically activates the tattoo, the wearer is the target of the power.
Any psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must pay the XP when creating the tattoo.

SIDESTEP CHARGE [PSIONIC]
You are skilled at dodging past charging opponents and taking advantage when they miss.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Dodge.
Benefit: You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against charge attacks. If a charging opponent fails to make a successful attack against you, you gain an immediate attack of opportunity. This feat does not grant you more attacks of opportunity than you are normally allowed in a round. If you are flat-footed or otherwise denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, you do not gain the benefit of this feat.

SPEED OF THOUGHT [PSIONIC]
The energy of your mind energizes the alacrity of your body.
Prerequisite: Wis 13.
Benefit: As long as you are psionically focused and not wearing heavy armor, you gain an insight bonus to your speed of 10 feet.

SPLIT PSIONIC RAY [METAPSIONIC]
You can affect two targets with a single ray.
Prerequisite: Any other metapsionic feat.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can split psionic rays you manifest. The split ray affects any two targets that are both within the power’s range and within 30 feet of each other. If the ray deals damage, each target takes as much damage as a single target would take.
Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2.

STAND STILL [GENERAL]
You can prevent foes from fleeing or closing.
Prerequisite: Str 13.
Benefit: When a foe’s movement out of a square you threaten grants you an attack of opportunity, you can give up that attack and instead attempt to stop your foe in his tracks. Make your attack of opportunity normally. If you hit your foe, he must succeed on a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your damage roll (the opponent does not actually take damage), or immediately halt as if he had used up his move actions for the round.
Since you use the Stand Still feat in place of your attack of opportunity, you can do so only a number of times per round equal to the number of times per round you could make an attack of opportunity (normally just one).
Normal: Attacks of opportunity cannot halt your foes in their tracks.

TALENTED [PSIONIC]
You can overchannel powers with less cost to yourself.
Prerequisite: Overchannel.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When manifesting a power of 3rd level or lower, you do not take damage from overchanneling.

TWIN POWER [METAPSIONIC]
You can manifest a power simultaneously with another power just like it.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can twin a power. Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take effect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the power (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of the resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a twinned psionic charm, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect).
Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

UNAVOIDABLE STRIKE [PSIONIC]
You can make an unarmed strike or use a natural weapon against your foe as if delivering a touch attack.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Psionic Fist, base attack bonus +5.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can resolve your unarmed strike or attack with a natural weapon as a touch attack.
You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

UNCONDITIONAL POWER [METAPSIONIC]
Disabling conditions do not hold you back.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Your mental strength is enough to overcome some otherwise disabling conditions. You can manifest an unconditional power when you are dazed, confused, nauseated, shaken, or stunned.
Only personal powers and powers that affect your person can be manifested as unconditional powers.
Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 8. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

UP THE WALLS [PSIONIC]
You can run on walls for brief distances.
Prerequisite: Wis 13.
Benefit: While you are psionically focused, you can take part of one of your move actions to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. The height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks of opportunity as you move up the wall.
Special: You can take other move actions in conjunction with moving along a wall. For instance, the Spring Attack feat allows you to make an attack from the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within the area you threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you fall. Likewise, you could tumble along the wall to avoid attacks of opportunity.

WIDEN POWER [METAPSIONIC]
You can increase the area of your powers.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread-shaped power to increase its area. (Powers that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.) Any numeric measurements of the power’s area increase by 100%.
Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

WILD TALENT [GENERAL]
Your mind wakes to a previously unrealized talent for psionics.
Benefit: Your latent power of psionics flares to life, conferring upon you the designation of a psionic character. As a psionic character, you gain a reserve of 2 power points and can take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats. You do not, however, gain the ability to manifest powers simply by virtue of having this feat.

WOUNDING ATTACK [PSIONIC]
Your vicious attacks wound your foe.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +8.
Benefit: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can make an attack with such vicious force that you wound your opponent. A wound deals 1 point of Constitution damage to your foe in addition to the usual damage dealt.
You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

Epic Feats
----------

EPIC FEATS

ACQUIRING EPIC FEATS
Characters gain epic feats in the following ways:
At 21st level, and every three levels thereafter, the character may select an epic feat in place of a nonepic feat.
Each character class gains bonus epic feats according to the class description. These feats must be selected from the list of bonus epic feats for that class.

PREREQUISITES
Most epic feats have prerequisites. A character must have the listed ability score, feat, skill, class feature, or base attack modifier in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain an epic feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite, just as with regular feats. A prerequisite expressed as a numerical value is a minimum; any value higher than the one given also meets the prerequisite. A character can’t use an epic feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.

TYPES OF EPIC FEATS
Most epic feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others may be item creation feats or metamagic feats, which follow all the normal rules for such feats, except as specified in the feat’s description. In addition, some feats are defined as divine feats or as wild feats. Such feats are described below.

DIVINE FEATS
The feats in this category share a few characteristics. First, they all have as a prerequisite the ability to turn (or, in most cases, rebuke) undead. Thus, they are open to clerics, paladins of 4th level or higher, and any prestige class that has that ability. (An ability to turn other creatures does not qualify a character to select one of these feats.) Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the ability to channel positive or negative energy to turn or rebuke undead. Each use of a divine feat costs the character one turn/rebuke attempt from his or her number of attempts each day. If a character doesn’t have any turn/rebuke attempts left, he or she can’t use the feat. Since turning or rebuking is a standard action, activating any of these feats is also a standard action.

WILD FEATS
The feats in this category share the characteristic of relating to the ability to use wild shape as a druid. These feats require the character to have the ability to use wild shape before acquiring the feat.

EPIC PSIONIC FEATS
Psionic characters can acquire epic “psionically flavored” feats.  Some feats require so much translation that converted feats are provided. Whenever a feat concerns conferring or altering a spell in some fashion, some translation must be done to use it with psionics. Sometimes this translation is as straightforward as changing a few names. Translating epic metamagic feats to epic metapsionic feats requires that Spellcraft prerequisites be replaced with Psicraft. It also requires a little math—instead of casting a spell at a higher level, a psionic character pays more power points. For every spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level the metamagic feat requires, the metapsionic feat requires a character to pay a power point cost equal to its standard cost +2. Likewise, when a feat allows a spellcaster to “pay” one less level to use a metamagic feat, the psionic version allows a character to pay 2 power points less for a given metapsionic feat.

FEATS

ADDITIONAL MAGIC ITEM SPACE [EPIC]
Benefit: Choose one type of magic item that has a limit on the number a character can simultaneously wear and gain its benefit. The character can now wear one more magic item of this type and also gain its benefit.
Normal: Without this feat, a character is limited to one headband, hat, or helmet; one pair of eye lenses or goggles; one cloak, cape, or mantle; one amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab; one suit of armor; one robe; one vest, vestment, or shirt; one pair of bracers or bracelets; one pair of gloves or gauntlets; two rings; one belt; and one pair of boots.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time the character takes the feat, it applies to a new type of wearable magic item.

ARMOR SKIN [EPIC]
Benefit: The character gains a +1 natural armor bonus to Armor Class, or his or her existing natural armor bonus increases by 1.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.

AUGMENTED ALCHEMY [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Int 21, Craft(alchemy) 24 ranks.
Benefit: Whenever creating an alchemical item or substance, the character can choose to make it more powerful than normal by adding +20 to the DC required to create it and multiplying its price by 5. If the item or substance deals damage, double the damage dealt. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage, double the duration of its effect. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage and doesn’t have a specific listed duration (or has an instantaneous duration), double all dimensions of its area. If the item or substance doesn’t fit any of these categories, then it cannot be affected by this feat. See the Craft (alchemy) skill description.

AUTOMATIC QUICKEN SPELL [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Quicken Spell, Spellcraft 30 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level arcane or divine spells.
Benefit: The character may cast all 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells as quickened spells without using higher-level spell slots. The normal limit to the number of quickened spells a character may cast per round applies. Spells with a casting time of more than 1 full round can’t be quickened.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character takes the feat, the spells of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now be quickened with no adjustment to their spell slots. This feat doesn’t increase the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when cast in metamagic form.

AUTOMATIC SILENT SPELL [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Silent Spell, Spellcraft 24 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level arcane or divine spells.
Benefit: The character may cast all 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells as silent spells without using higher-level spell slots.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character takes the feat, the spells of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now be silenced with no adjustment to their spell slots. This feat doesn’t increase the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when cast in metamagic form. However, since bard spells can’t be enhanced with the Silent Spell feat, they can’t be affected by this feat either.

AUTOMATIC STILL SPELL [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Still Spell, Spellcraft 27 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level arcane or divine spells.
Benefit: The character may cast all 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells as stilled spells without using higher-level spell slots.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character takes the feat, the spells of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now be stilled with no adjustment to their spell slots. This feat doesn’t increase the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when cast in metamagic form.

BANE OF ENEMIES [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Survival 24 ranks, five or more favored enemies.
Benefit: Any weapon the character wields against one of his or her favored enemies is treated as a bane weapon for that creature type (thus, its enhancement bonus is increased by +2 and it deals +2d6 points of damage). This ability doesn’t stack with similar abilities.

BLINDING SPEED [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Dex 25.
Benefit: The character can act as if hasted for 5 rounds each day. The duration of the effect need not be consecutive rounds. Activating this power is a free action.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or she takes the feat, it grants an additional 5 rounds of haste per day.

BONUS DOMAIN [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Wis 21, ability to cast 9th-level divine spells.
Benefit: Choose an additional domain from the character’s deity’s domain list. The character now has access to that domain’s spells as normal for his or her domain spells and the domain’s granted powers.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or she takes the feat, it applies to a different domain.

BULWARK OF DEFENSE [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Con 25, defensive stance 3/day.
Benefit: The character’s defensive stance bonuses increase to +4 Strength, +6 Constitution, +4 resistance bonus on all saves, and +6 dodge bonus to AC.

CHAOTIC RAGE [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Rage 5/day, chaotic alignment.
Benefit: Any weapon the character wields while in a rage is treated as an anarchic weapon (it is chaos-aligned and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against creatures of lawful alignment). This ability does not stack with similar abilities.

COLOSSAL WILD SHAPE [WILD][EPIC]
Prerequisite: The ability to wild shape into a Gargantuan creature.
Benefit: The character can use his or her wild shape to take the shape of a Colossal animal.
Normal: Without this feat, a character cannot wild shape into an animal of greater than Huge size.

COMBAT ARCHERY [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Dodge, Mobility, Point Blank Shot.
Benefit: The character does not incur any attacks of opportunity for firing a bow when threatened.
Normal: Without this feat, a character incurs an attack of opportunity from all opponents who threaten him or her whenever he or she uses a bow.

DAMAGE REDUCTION [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Con 21.
Benefit: The character gains damage reduction 3/–. This does not stack with damage reduction granted by magic items or nonpermanent magical effects, but it does stack with any damage reduction granted by permanent magical effects, class features, or this feat itself.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or she gains the feat, his or her damage reduction increases by 3.

DEAFENING SONG [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Perform 24 ranks, bardic music class feature.
Benefit: The character can use song or poetics to temporarily deafen all enemies within a 30-foot spread from him or her. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the character’s class level + the character’s Charisma modifier) negates the effect. The deafening effect lasts for as long as the character continues the deafening song. The character can choose to exclude any characters from this effect. The character may sing, play, or recite a deafening song while taking other mundane actions, but not magical ones (see the bard’s inspire courage ability for more details). The character may keep up the deafening song for a maximum of 10 rounds. Using the deafening song counts as one of the character’s uses of song or poetics for the day.

DEATH OF ENEMIES [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Bane of Enemies, Survival 30 ranks, five or more favored enemies.
Benefit: Any time the character scores a critical hit against one of his or her favored enemies, it must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 character’s ranger class level + character’s Wisdom modifier) or die instantly.

Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time a character takes the feat, it applies to a different type of weapon.

DEXTEROUS FORTITUDE [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Dex 25, slippery mind class feature.
Benefit: Once per round, when targeted by an effect that requires a Fortitude saving throw, the character may make a Reflex save instead to avoid the effect (evasion is not applicable).

Benefit: Once per round, when targeted by an effect that requires a Will saving throw, the character may make a Reflex save instead to avoid the effect (evasion is not applicable).

DIMINUTIVE WILD SHAPE [WILD][EPIC]
Prerequisite: Ability to wild shape into a Huge animal.
Benefit: The character can use wild shape to take the shape of a Diminutive animal.
Normal: Without this feat, a character cannot wild shape into an animal of smaller than Tiny size.

DIRE CHARGE [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Improved Initiative.
Benefit: If the character charges a foe during the first round of combat (or the surprise round, if the character is allowed to act in it), he or she can make a full attack against the opponent charged.
Normal: Without this feat, a character may only make a single attack as part of a charge.

DISTANT SHOT [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Dex 25, Far Shot, Point Blank Shot, Spot 20 ranks.
Benefit: The character may throw or fire a ranged weapon at any target within line of sight, with no penalty for range.

Prerequisites: Wis 30, Knowledge (nature) 30 ranks, wild shape 6/day.
Benefit: The character may use wild shape to change into a dragon (black, blue, green, red, white, brass, bronze, copper, gold, or silver). The size limitation is the same as the character’s limitation on animal size. The character gains all extraordinary and supernatural abilities of the dragon whose form he or she takes.

EFFICIENT ITEM CREATION [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Item creation feat to be selected, Knowledge (arcana) 24 ranks, Spellcraft 24 ranks.
Benefit: Select an item creation feat. Creating a magic item using that feat requires one day per 10,000 gp of the item’s market price, with a minimum of one day.
Normal: Without this feat, creating a magic item requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the item’s market price.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time a character takes the feat, it applies to a different item creation feat.

ENERGY RESISTANCE [EPIC]
Benefit: Choose a type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The character gains resistance 10 to that type of energy, or the character’s existing resistance to that type of energy increases by 10. This feat does not stack with energy resistance granted by magic items or nonpermanent magical effects.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. If the same type of energy is chosen, the effects stack.

ENHANCE SPELL [METAMAGIC][EPIC]
Prerequisite: Maximize Spell.

Even though the table only includes ability scores up to 61 and spell slots up to 25th level, the progression continues infinitely in both directions. For ability scores beyond 61, or for spell slots above 25th level, expand the table to follow the same patterns as shown.

IMPROVED SPELL RESISTANCE [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Must have spell resistance from a feat, class feature, or other permanent effect.
Benefit: The character’s spell resistance increases by +2.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.

IMPROVED STUNNING FIST [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Dex 19, Wis 19, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist.
Benefit: Add +2 to the DC of the character’s stunning attack.
Special: This feat may be taken multiple times. Its effects stack.

IMPROVED WHIRLWIND ATTACK [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Int 13, Dex 23, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack.
Benefit: As a standard action, the character can make one melee attack for every five points of his or her base attack bonus (including epic attack bonus, round fractions down).
The character cannot attack any one opponent more than once as part of this action.  These attacks (as well as all other attacks made until the start of the character’s next turn) suffer a –4 penalty.
When using the Improved Whirlwind feat, the character also forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other spells or abilities (such as Cleave or the haste spell).
Since these attacks are made as part of a standard action the character can’t make a 5-foot step between any two of the attacks.
Normal: Without this feat, using the Whirlwind Attack feat requires a full attack action, and the character can take a 5-foot step between any two of the attacks.

INCITE RAGE [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Cha 25, greater rage class feature.
Benefit: When the character enters a rage, he or she can incite a barbarian rage in any or all allies within 60 feet. (Any ally who doesn’t wish to become enraged is unaffected.) The ally gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a –2 penalty to AC, for as long as the character remains raging. The rage of affected allies lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier, regardless of whether they remain within 60 feet of the character. This is otherwise identical with normal barbarian rage (including the fatigue at its end).
Special: This is a mind-affecting effect.

INFINITE DEFLECTION [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Dex 25, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike.
Benefit: The character may perform any number of deflections each round, as the Deflect Arrows feat.

INSPIRE EXCELLENCE [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Perform 30 ranks, bardic music class feature.
Benefit: The character can use song or poetics to grant a bonus to one ability score to his or her allies. To be affected, an ally must hear the bard sing for 1 full round. The effect lasts as long as the bard sings and for 5 rounds after the bard stops singing (or 5 rounds after the ally can no longer hear the bard). While singing, the bard can fight but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by command word (such as wands). Each ally to be inspired gains a +4 competence bonus to the same ability score, which the character must choose before he or she begins inspiring. Inspire excellence is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability. Use of this feat counts as one of the character’s bardic music uses for the day.
Special: This feat is treated as a bardic music inspiration ability for purposes of feats that affect such abilities.

INSTANT RELOAD [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Quick Draw, Rapid Reload, Weapon Focus (crossbow type to be selected).
Benefit: The character may fire the selected type of crossbow at his or her full normal attack rate. Reloading the crossbow does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

INTENSIFY SPELL [METAMAGIC][EPIC]
Prerequisites: Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, Spellcraft 30 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level arcane or divine spells.
Benefit: All variable, numeric effects of an intensified spell are maximized, then doubled. An intensified spell deals twice maximum damage, cures twice the maximum number of hit points, affects twice the maximum number of targets, and so forth, as appropriate. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. An intensified spell uses up a spell slot seven levels higher than the spell’s actual level. A character can’t combine the effects of this feat with any other feat that affects the variable, numeric effects of a spell.

KEEN STRIKE [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Str 23, Wis 23, Improved Critical (unarmed strike), Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning fist, ki strike (adamantine).
Benefit: The character’s unarmed strike has a critical threat range of 18-20 and deals slashing damage (at the character’s option any attack can deal bludgeoning damage, but cannot then take advantage of the enhanced threat range). This ability doesn’t stack with other abilities that expand that character’s unarmed strike’s threat range.

LASTING INSPIRATION [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Perform 25 ranks, bardic music class feature.
Benefit: The effects of the character’s bardic music inspiration abilities last for ten times as long as normal after he or she stops singing. This feat has no effect on inspiration abilities that have no duration after the character stops singing.

LEGENDARY CLIMBER [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Dex 21, Balance 12 ranks, Climb 24 ranks.
Benefit: The character can ignore any check penalties applied for accelerated climbing or rapid climbing.

LEGENDARY COMMANDER [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Cha 25, Epic Leadership, Leadership, Diplomacy 30 ranks, must rule own kingdom and have a stronghold.

LEGENDARY RIDER [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Ride 24 ranks.
Benefit: The character doesn’t take a penalty on Ride checks when riding a mount without a saddle (bareback).  The character never needs to make a Ride check to control a mount in combat (and even controlling a mount not trained for combat doesn’t require an action).
Normal: Without this feat, a character takes a –5 penalty on Ride checks without a saddle, and must make a Ride check to control a mount in combat (and controlling a mount not trained for combat requires a move action).

LEGENDARY TRACKER [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Wis 25, Track, Knowledge (nature) 30 ranks, Survival 30 ranks.
Benefit: The character can track creatures across water, under-water, or through the air. This adds the surfaces of water, underwater, and air to the list of surfaces found under the Track feat:

MASTER STAFF [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Craft Staff, Spellcraft 15 ranks.
Benefit: When the character activates a staff, he or she can substitute a spell slot instead of using a charge. The spell slot must be one the character ahs not used for the day, though the character may lose a prepared spell to emulate a wand charge (the character may not lose prepared spells from his or her school of specialty, if any). The spell slot lost must be equal to or higher in level than the specific spell stored in the staff, including any level-increasing metamagic enhancements. A character cannot emulate a charge for a staff function that does not match a specific spell.

MASTER WAND [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Craft Wand, Spellcraft 15 ranks.
Benefit: When the character activates a wand, he or she can substitute a spell slot instead of using a charge. The spell slot must be one the character has not used for the day, though he or she may lose a prepared spell to emulate a wand charge (the character may not lose prepared spells from his or her school of specialty, if any). The spell slot lost must be equal to or higher in level than the spell stored in the wand, including any level-increasing metamagic enhancements.

MIGHTY RAGE [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Str 21, Con 21, greater rage class feature, rage 5/day.
Benefit: When the character rages, he or she gains a +8 bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +4 morale bonus on Will saves. (These bonuses replace the normal rage bonuses.)

Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.

MULTIWEAPON REND [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Dex 15, base attack bonus +9, three or more hands, Multiweapon Fighting.
Benefit: If the character hits an opponent with two or more weapons (wielded in different hands) in the same round, he or she may automatically rend the opponent. This rending deals additional damage equal to the base damage of the smallest weapon that hit plus 1 1/2 times the character’s Strength modifier. The character can only rend once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks he or she makes.
Special: This feat replaces the Two-Weapon Rend feat for creatures with more than two arms.

MUSIC OF THE GODS [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Cha 25, Perform 30 ranks, bardic music class feature.
Benefit: The character’s bardic music can affect even those normally immune to mind-affecting effects. However, such creatures gain a +10 bonus on their Will saves to resist such effects.

NEGATIVE ENERGY BURST [DIVINE][EPIC]
Prerequisites: Cha 25, ability to rebuke or command undead, ability to cast inflict critical wounds, any evil alignment.
Benefit: The character can use one rebuke or command undead attempt to unleash a wave of negative energy in a 60-foot-burst. Roll a normal rebuke (or command) check, except that the negative energy burst affects living creatures rather than undead. Any creature that would be rebuked by this result gains one negative level. Any creature that would be commanded by this check gains two negative levels. The Fortitude save DC to remove these levels one day later is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character’s effective turning level + the character’s Charisma modifier.

Creatures immune to critical hits can’t be affected by this feat.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time a character takes the feat, it applies to a different type of weapon.

PENETRATE DAMAGE REDUCTION [EPIC]
Select a special material, such as adamantine.

None of the other special properties of special materials are gained by the character’s melee weapons.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times.  Each time the feat is selected the character selects a different special material.  The character’s melee attacks are treated as being crafted of all chosen materials for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.

Prerequisites: Spellcraft 25 ranks, ability to cast the spell to be made permanent.
Benefit: Designate any one of the character’s spells whose area is an emanation from the character. This spell’s effect is permanent (though the character can dismiss or restart it as a free action). Effects that would normally dispel this spell instead suppress it for 2d4 rounds.

PLANAR TURNING [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Wis 25, Cha 25, ability to turn or rebuke undead.
Benefit: The character can turn or rebuke outsiders as if they were undead. An outsider has effective turn resistance equal to half its spell resistance (round down).

POSITIVE ENERGY AURA [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Cha 25, ability to turn undead, ability to cast dispel evil.
Benefit: Every undead creature that comes within 15 feet of the character is automatically affected as if the character had turned it. This doesn’t cost a turning attempt, and the character doesn’t have to roll turning damage (it automatically affects all undead in a 15-foot burst), but it only turns undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than the character’s effective cleric level minus 10 (and automatically destroys undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than the character’s effective cleric level minus 20). Just as with normal turning, the character can’t affect undead that have total cover relative to him or her.

You cannot bestow a power upon your psicrystal if the power normally has any experience point cost.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, you can give your psicrystal knowledge of a new power (and it gains sufficient power points to manifest that power once).

RANGED INSPIRATION [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Bardic music class feature, Perform 25 ranks
Benefit: Double the range of any bardic music ability that has a range. (If the creature must hear the bard to be affected by the ability, that requirement doesn’t change regardless of any extended range the bard’s ability may have.)
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack. Remember that two doublings equals a tripling, and so forth.

RAPID INSPIRATION [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Perform 25 ranks, bardic music class feature.
Benefit: The character can use any of his or her bardic music inspiration abilities as a standard action. The inspiration takes effect immediately after the character concludes the action.

REACTIVE COUNTERSONG [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Combat Reflexes, Perform 30 ranks, bardic music class feature.
Benefit: The character can begin a countersong at any time, even when it isn’t his or her turn (much like a wizard who has readied a counterspell action), though the character doesn’t have to ready an action to do so.

Normal: Without this feat, a character can only use counter-song on his or her turn.

Prerequisites: Wis 19, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, any lawful alignment.

RUINOUS RAGE [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Str 25, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, rage 5/day.
Benefit: While in a rage, the character ignores the hardness of any object he or she strikes. Also, double the character’s Strength bonus for the purposes of any Strength check made to break an object with sudden force rather than by dealing normal damage (including bursting bindings, such as ropes or manacles).

SCRIBE EPIC SCROLL [ITEM CREATION][EPIC]
Prerequisites: Scribe Scroll, Knowledge (arcana) 24 ranks, Spellcraft 24 ranks.
Benefit: The character can scribe scrolls that exceed the normal limits for such items. Even this feat does not allow the character to scribe a scroll with an epic spell.

SELF-CONCEALMENT [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Dex 30, Hide 30 ranks, Tumble 30 ranks, improved evasion.
Benefit: Attacks against the character have a 10% miss chance, similar to the effect of concealment. The character loses this benefit whenever he or she would lose his or her Dexterity bonus to AC.

SHATTERING STRIKE [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Epic Weapon Focus (unarmed strike), Weapon Focus (unarmed strike), Concentration 25 ranks, ki strike (adamantine).
Benefit: When using an unarmed strike to attempt to break an object with sudden force (rather than by dealing normal damage), make a Concentration check rather than a Strength check. The break DC remains the same. Using Shattering Strike is a full-round action that incurs attacks of opportunity. The character can’t use Shattering Strike to escape bonds (unless he or she is so bound as to allow the character to make an unarmed strike against his or her bindings).

SNEAK ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Sneak attack +8d6, opportunist class feature.

SPELL OPPORTUNITY [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Combat Casting, Combat Reflexes, Quicken Spell, Spellcraft 25 ranks.
Benefit: Whenever the character is allowed an attack of opportunity, he or she may cast (and attack with) a touch spell as the character’s attack of opportunity. This incurs attacks of opportunity just as if the character had cast the spell normally.
Normal: Without this feat, a character can only make a melee attack as an attack of opportunity.

SPELL STOWAWAY [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Spellcraft 24 ranks, caster level 12th.
Benefit: Choose a spell-like ability the character knows, or a spell the character cam cast.  The character is attuned to the magic he or she chooses. If another spellcaster within 300 feet of the character uses this magic, the character also immediately gains the magic’s effect as if it had been used on the character by the same caster. The character must have direct line of effect to the spellcaster in order to gain the benefit of the attuned magic (though the character does not have to know the spellcaster is present, and he or she can be flat-footed). The magic’s duration, effect, and other specifics are determined by its original caster’s level.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time a character takes the feat, it applies to a different spell or spell-like ability.

SPELLCASTING HARRIER [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Combat Reflexes.
Benefit: Any spellcaster the character threatens in melee provokes an attack of opportunity if he or she tries to cast defensively.  The character gets a +4 bonus on this attack roll.

Benefit: Select a domain the character has access to. The character may spontaneously convert any prepared cleric spell (except a domain spell) into a domain spell of the same level in the selected domain, just as a cleric channels energy to convert spells into cure spells.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character takes the feat, it applies to a different domain.

SPONTANEOUS SPELL [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Spellcraft 25 ranks, ability to cast the maximum normal spell level of at least one spell-casting class.
Benefit: Select a spell the character can cast. The character may spontaneously convert any prepared spell of the selected spell’s level into the selected spell, just as a cleric channels energy to convert spells into cure spells.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or she takes the feat, it applies to a different spell.

STORM OF THROWS [EPIC]
Prerequisite: Dex 23, Point Blank Shot, Quick Draw, Rapid Shot.
Benefit: As a full-round action, the character may throw a light weapon at his or her full base attack bonus at each opponent within 30 feet. All light weapons thrown need not be the same type.

An enemy with Hit Dice greater than twice your character level is not affected by this feat.

TENACIOUS MAGIC [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Spellcraft 15 ranks.
Benefit: Choose one spell the character knows or spell-like ability the character possesses. Whenever the chosen form of magic would otherwise end due to a dispel effect, the magic is instead only suppressed for 1d4 rounds. The magic still ends when its duration expires, but the suppressed rounds do not count against its duration. The character can dismiss his or her own spell or spell-like ability (if dismissible) or dispel his or her own tenacious magic normally.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or she takes the feat, it applies to a different spell or spell-like ability.

THUNDERING RAGE [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Str 25, rage 5/day.
Benefit: Any weapon the character wields while in a rage is treated as a thundering weapon. The DC of the Fortitude save to resist deafness is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character’s level. This ability does not stack with similar abilities.

UNCANNY ACCURACY [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Dex 21, base attack bonus +11, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Improved Precise Shot, Spot 20 ranks.

Normal: Without this feat, characters suffer a 50% miss chance when making a ranged attack against a target with total concealment.

Benefit: The character may command up to ten times his or her level in HD of undead.

UNHOLY STRIKE [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Smite good class feature, any evil alignment.
Benefit: Any weapon the character wields is treated as an unholy weapon (it is evil-aligned and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against creatures of good alignment).

VERMIN WILD SHAPE [WILD][EPIC]
Prerequisites: Knowledge (nature) 24 ranks, wild shape 6/day.
Benefit: The character can use his or her normal wild shape ability to take the form of a vermin. The size limitation is the same as the character’s limitation on animal size.

VORPAL STRIKE [EPIC]
Prerequisites: Str 25, Wis 25, Improved Critical (unarmed strike), Improved Unarmed Strike, Keen Strike, Stunning Fist, ki strike (adamantine).
Benefit: The character’s unarmed strike is considered to be a slashing vorpal weapon. (At the character’s option, any unarmed strike can do bludgeoning damage instead, but it loses the vorpal quality.) This ability doesn’t stack with similar abilities

The character animates a total number of HD of undead equal to the number of undead that would be commanded by the character’s result (though the character can’t animate more undead than there are available corpses within range). The character can’t animate more undead with any single attempt than the maximum number he or she can command (including any undead already under his or her command). These undead are automatically under the character’s command, though his or her normal limit of commanded undead still applies. If the corpses are relatively fresh, the animated undead are zombies. Otherwise, they are skeletons.



These feats are not epic feats, so they may be selected by character any time he or she could select a new feat.

GREATER MULTIWEAPON FIGHTING [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 19, three or more arms, Improved Multiweapon Fighting, Multiweapon Fighting, base attack bonus +15.
Benefit: The creature may make up to three extra attacks with each extra offhand weapon it wields, albeit at a –10 penalty on the third attack with each weapon.
Special: This feat replaces the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat for creatures with more than two arms.

IMPROVED FLYBY ATTACK [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Fly speed, Dodge, Flyby Attack, Mobility.
Benefit: If the standard action taken by a creature during a round in which it uses Flyby Attack is a melee attack, the creature provokes no attacks of opportunity from moving out of squares threatened by its target.
Normal: Without this feat, a creature making an attack as part of a Flyby Attack maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity as normal from moving out of squares threatened by its target.

IMPROVED MULTIATTACK [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Three or more natural weapons, Multiattack
Benefit: The creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons have no penalty. They still add only one-half the creature’s Strength bonus, if any, to damage dealt.
Normal: Without this feat, the creature’s secondary natural attacks have a –5 penalty (or a –2 penalty if it has the Multiattack feat).

IMPROVED MULTIWEAPON FIGHTING [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 15, three or more arms, Multiweapon Fighting, base attack bonus +9.
Benefit: In addition to the single extra attack a creature gets with each extra weapon from Multiweapon Fighting, it gets a second attack with each extra weapon, albeit at a –5 penalty.
Normal: With only Multiweapon Fighting, a creater can only get a single attack with each extra weapon.
Special: This feat replaces the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat for creatures with more than two arms.

Monster Feats
-------------

MONSTER FEATS
These feats apply to abilities most commonly found amongst monsters or are related to monsters.

ABILITY FOCUS  [GENERAL]
Choose one of the creature’s special attacks.
Prerequisite: Special attack.
Benefit: Add +2 to the DC for all saving throws against the special attack on which the creature focuses.
Special: A creature can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time the creature takes the feat it applies to a different special attack.

AWESOME BLOW [GENERAL, FIGHTER]
Prerequisites: Str 25, Power Attack, Improved Bull Rush, size Large or larger.
Benefit: As a standard action, the creature may choose to subtract 4 from its melee attack roll and deliver an awesome blow. If the creature hits a corporeal opponent smaller than itself with an awesome blow, its opponent must succeed on a Reflex save (DC = damage dealt) or be knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the attacking creature’s choice and fall prone. The attacking creature can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can’t move closer to the attacking creature than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent’s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent stops in the space adjacent to the obstacle.

CRAFT CONSTRUCT [ITEM CREATION]
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item.
Benefit: A creature with this feat can create any construct whose prerequisites it meets. Enchanting a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To enchant a construct, a spellcaster must spend 1/25 the item’s price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of this price (see individual construct monster entries for details).
A creature with this feat can repair constructs that have taken damage. In one day of work, the creature can repair up to 20 points of damage by expending 50 gp per point of damage repaired.
A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit Dice.

EMPOWER SPELL-LIKE ABILITY  [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.
Benefit: Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).
When a creature uses an empowered spell-like ability, all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased by one half. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. Spell-like abilities without random variables are not affected.
The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round down) –2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat.
Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.

FLYBY ATTACK  [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Fly speed.
Benefit: When flying, the creature can take a move action (including a dive) and another standard action at any point during the move. The creature cannot take a second move action during a round when it makes a flyby attack.
Normal: Without this feat, the creature takes a standard action either before or after its move.

HOVER  [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Fly speed.
Benefit: When flying, the creature can halt its forward motion and hover in place as a move action. It can then fly in any direction, including straight down or straight up, at half speed, regardless of its maneuverability.
If a creature begins its turn hovering, it can hover in place for the turn and take a full-round action. A hovering creature cannot make wing attacks, but it can attack with all other limbs and appendages it could use in a full attack. The creature can instead use a breath weapon or cast a spell instead of making physical attacks, if it could normally do so.
If a creature of Large size or larger hovers within 20 feet of the ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft from its wings creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds so generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of non-magical origin. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures have concealment at 15 to 20 feet (20% miss chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures have total concealment (50% miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate the creature).
Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD) to cast a spell.
Normal: Without this feat, a creature must keep moving while flying unless it has perfect maneuverability.

IMPROVED NATURAL ARMOR  [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Natural armor, Con 13.
Benefit: The creature’s natural armor bonus increases by 1.
Special: A creature can gain this feat multiple times. Each time the creature takes the feat its natural armor bonus increases by another point.

IMPROVED NATURAL ATTACK  [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Natural weapon, base attack bonus +4.
Benefit: Choose one of the creature’s natural attack forms. The damage for this natural weapon increases by one step, as if the creature’s size had increased by one category: 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d6, 3d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6.
A weapon or attack that deals 1d10 points of damage increases as follows: 1d10, 2d8, 3d8, 4d8, 6d8, 8d8, 12d8.

MULTIATTACK  [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Three or more natural attacks.
Benefit: The creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons take only a –2 penalty.
Normal: Without this feat, the creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons take a –5 penalty.

MULTIWEAPON FIGHTING  [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 13, three or more hands.
Benefit: Penalties for fighting with multiple weapons are reduced by 2 with the primary hand and reduced by 6 with off hands.
Normal: A creature without this feat takes a –6 penalty on attacks made with its primary hand and a –10 penalty on attacks made with its off hands. (It has one primary hand, and all the others are off hands.) See Two-Weapon Fighting.
Special: This feat replaces the Two-Weapon Fighting feat for creatures with more than two arms.

QUICKEN SPELL-LIKE ABILITY  [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Spell-like ability at caster level 10th or higher.
Benefit: Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described below. The creature can use that ability as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).
Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another action—including the use of another spell-like ability—in the same round that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use only one quickened spell-like ability per round.
The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round down) –4. For a summary, see the table below.
In addition, a spell-like ability that duplicates a spell with a casting time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened.
Normal: Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity unless noted otherwise.
Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.

SNATCH  [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Size Huge or larger.
Benefits: The creature can choose to start a grapple when it hits with a claw or bite attack, as though it had the improved grab special attack. If the creature gets a hold on a creature three or more sizes smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic bite or claw damage. A snatched opponent held in the creature’s mouth is not allowed a Reflex save against the creature’s breath weapon, if it has one.
The creature can drop a creature it has snatched as a free action or use a standard action to fling it aside. A flung creature travels 1d6 x 10 feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet traveled. If the creature flings a snatched opponent while flying, the opponent takes this amount or falling damage, whichever is greater.

WINGOVER  [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Fly speed.
Benefits: A flying creature with this feat can change direction quickly once each round as a free action. This feat allows it to turn up to 180 degrees regardless of its maneuverability, in addition to any other turns it is normally allowed. A creature cannot gain altitude during a round when it executes a wingover, but it can dive.
The change of direction consumes 10 feet of flying movement.

Salient Divine Abilities
------------------------

SALIENT DIVINE ABILITIES

A salient divine ability is like a feat—it gives a deity a new capability or improves one that the deity already has. A deity has one salient divine ability for each divine rank the deity has, plus additional salient divine abilities reflecting its status: Demigods receive one bonus ability, lesser deities receive two bonus abilities, intermediate deities receive three, and greater deities receive five.
Some salient divine abilities have prerequisites. Usually, the deity must have all the listed prerequisites to have the ability. A divine rank of 1 is a prerequisite for all salient divine abilities. The most common salient divine abilities are described here. A few deities have unique salient divine abilities that are described in the deity’s individual entry.

Using Salient Divine Abilities: Using a salient divine ability is a standard action unless otherwise noted in the ability description. Using a salient divine ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Salient Divine Abilities and Antimagic: A salient divine ability functions normally within an antimagic field, and is never subject to spell resistance.

Salient Divine Ability Descriptions
Here is the format for salient divine ability descriptions.

Ability Name
Prerequisite: A minimum divine rank, minimum ability score, another salient divine ability, a minimum base attack bonus, a feat, a skill, or some other condition that a deity must have in order to acquire this salient divine ability. This entry is absent if a salient divine ability has no prerequisite. An ability may have more than one prerequisite. All salient divine abilities have a minimum prerequisite of divine rank 1. Quasi-deities (rank 0) have no salient divine abilities.
Benefit: What the ability enables the deity to do. If a deity has the same ability more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description. In general, having a salient divine ability twice is the same as having it once.
Notes: Additional facts about the ability that may be helpful when using the ability in play.
Rest: Some abilities require the deity to rest afterward. If no rest is required, the entry is absent. A resting deity can engage in light activities such as talking or walking at half speed. When attempting anything more strenuous than that, the deity can only take partial actions and suffers a –6 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The deity cannot use another ability that requires rest until its current rest requirement is fulfilled. Any time the deity spends performing strenuous activities does not count toward the required rest time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: This entry gives one or more portfolio elements that are associated with the salient divine ability in question. The information is provided as guidance and should not be taken as a rule.


Alter Form
This is an extraordinary ability.
Prerequisite: Alter Size salient divine ability.
Benefit: As a move-equivalent action, the deity can alter its form, including clothing and equipment. The assumed form must be corporeal. The deity’s body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding or subtracting one or two limbs. If the form selected has wings, the deity can fly. Likewise, the deity can swim if the form has fins, breathe water if the form has gills, and so on.
The deity can remain in the altered form indefinitely, but resumes its own form if slain.
Notes: The deity’s attack bonus, Armor Class, and saves do not change. The deity does not gain any of the assumed form’s special abilities, attack forms, defenses, ability scores, or mannerisms. The deity can change physical qualities (such as hair color, hair
texture, skin color, and gender). The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +10 on its Disguise checks. The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously along with this one to become taller, shorter, thinner, or heavier.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Nature, secrets, thieves.

Alter Reality
Prerequisite: Cha 29.
Benefit: This ability is similar to the wish spell. The deity merely thinks of something and then makes it so. Doing this requires at least a standard action.
Notes: The deity can duplicate any spell of 9th level or lower as a standard action. The duplicated spell has no material or XP component, and the DC of its saving throw (if one is allowed) is 20 + the deity’s rank + the deity’s Charisma modifier.
The deity also can duplicate a spell with any metamagic feat (so long as the metamagic feat is available to characters of 20th level or lower). This use of the ability requires the deity to rest for 1 round for each level that the feat would normally add to the spell. It still takes a standard action to use this ability, so there is no point in using the ability to duplicate a quickened spell.
The deity can render a magical or supernatural effect permanent. The rest requirement varies with the effect: 10 minutes per level of the effect times the number of subjects affected, 10 minutes per total Hit Dice of creatures affected, or 10 minutes per 10-foot cube affected. Use the highest applicable value.
The deity can create temporary, nonmagical objects. This works like the Create Object ability (including the required rest period), except that the items last one day per rank.
The deity also can create permanent nonmagical objects as if using the Create Object ability except that all rest requirements are doubled and there is no reduction in rest time for being on an Outer Plane or in the deity’s own realm.
The deity can create temporary magic items or creatures. This works like the Divine Creation ability (including the required rest period), except that the items or creatures created last 1 hour per rank. This ability cannot create permanent magic items or creatures.
The deity can reshape a landscape, creating any type of terrain the deity can imagine. Each 10-foot cube of material to be reshaped requires 1 round of effort, and the deity must rest for one day per 10-foot cube shaped after the work is completed.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Alter Size
Benefit: As a free action, the deity can assume any size from Fine to Colossal. The deity also can change the size of up to 100 pounds of objects it touches. If the deity has a familiar, personal mount, or personal intelligent weapon, the creature can change size with the deity if the deity touches it, but its weight counts against the deity’s weight limit. This is a supernatural ability.
Notes: This ability allows the deity to assume any proportions from the size of a grain of sand up or as much as 1,600 feet tall. A radical change in size can have great impact on the deity’s combat ability. The deity’s Strength, Armor Class, attack bonus, and damage dealt with weapons changes according to the size the deity assumes. The deity’s Strength
score can never be reduced to less than 1 through this ability. Also note that use of this divine ability does not affect all the deities’ characteristics.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Annihilating Strike
Prerequisites: Divine rank 11, base attack bonus +20, Str 25.
Benefit: When the deity strikes with a weapon or natural weapon, the opponent struck might be obliterated. Creatures, attended objects, and magic items must make Fortitude saves (DC 20 + the deity’s rank + the damage dealt) or be reduced to –10 hit points and killed outright. Unattended, nonmagical objects are obliterated. The deity can destroy up to 1,000 cubic feet (a 10-foot cube) of nonliving matter per rank, so the ability destroys only part of any very large object or structure targeted.
Notes: Deities with a rank equal to or greater than the attacking deity are not subject to this ability. This ability has no effect on objects or effects that are not subject to physical attacks.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death, justice, vengeance, war.

Arcane Mastery
Prerequisites: Spellcaster level 1st, Int 29, Spell Mastery.
Benefit: The deity can prepare any wizard spell that it can cast without using a spellbook.
Notes: This ability gives the deity access to every spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list, provided that the deity has sufficient wizard levels and a sufficient Intelligence score to cast them. The deity also can invent new sorcerer/wizard spells without researching them.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Knowledge, magic.

Area Divine Shield
Prerequisites: Divine rank 6, Cha 29, Divine Shield salient divine ability.
Benefit: Except where noted here, this ability works like the Divine Shield ability. The deity produces a transparent barrier whose area is up to one 10-foot square per rank, or a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 foot per rank. The barrier can be placed anywhere within the deity’s line of sight. The deity can place the barrier so that it is mobile with respect to some unattended object or willing creature. The barrier can be adjusted to ignore certain types of damage, just as a divine shield can. If the deity makes the shield mobile with respect to a willing creature, the deity also can make the barrier
one-way with respect to the creature and its allies, allowing them to attack through the shield and still use its protection.
Notes: The deity can shape the shield around itself or around a willing creature so that it is skintight, which prevents the subject from being touched.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Mercy, protection.

Automatic Metamagic
Prerequisite: Spellcaster level 1st.
Benefit: The deity chooses one metamagic feat. As a free action, the deity can apply the selected feat to the spells from any one spellcasting class the deity has or to its spell-like abilities. A spell altered by the use of this ability does not use up a higher-level slot.
Notes: The deity must obey all the limitations normally associated with the metamagic feat. Any metamagic feat selected cannot have a level requirement of 21st or higher. Feats that depend on making the spell’s level higher, such as Heighten Spell, do not work with this ability. A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a metamagic feat and either a spellcasting class or spell-like abilities to which the ability will apply each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Knowledge, magic.

Avatar
Prerequisites: Divine rank 6, Cha 29.
Benefit: An avatar serves as a deity’s alter ego, effectively allowing the deity to be in two or more places at the same time. An avatar is an extension of a deity. The deity senses and knows everything the avatar senses and knows and vice versa. Each avatar counts as a remote location where the deity is sensing and communicating. A lesser deity can have up to five avatars at once, an intermediate deity can have up to ten, and a greater deity can have up to twenty avatars at once. It takes a deity one year to create an avatar or replace a destroyed avatar. The process does not require any special effort on the deity’s
part. An avatar must be created in the deity’s own realm. If the deity has the Divine Creation salient divine ability, the deity can use it to create a new avatar anywhere. However, the deity must rest afterward as noted in the Divine Creation ability description. An avatar is a less powerful version of a deity, created by modifying the deity’s statistics, that has the following characteristics.
Divine Rank: The avatar’s divine rank is half that of the deity (round down). This decrease in divine rank affects many of the avatar’s statistics and abilities, including bonuses to attack rolls, damage, saves, checks, and Armor Class, damage reduction, resistances, number of salient divine abilities and bonus salient divine abilities, uses per day of domain powers, saving throw DCs against spell-like abilities, range of senses, automatic actions, magic items it can create, and extent of divine aura. The deity’s ability scores, speed, class levels, and Hit Dice are unchanged.
Divine Abilities: The avatar has salient divine abilities according to its own divine rank. The deity chooses which of its abilities the avatar has when creating the avatar. The avatar cannot have a salient divine ability that is not available to a deity of its own rank,
nor can it use a salient divine ability if it doesn’t meet the prerequisites. An avatar cannot have the Avatar or Possess Mortal salient divine abilities.
An avatar does not have any remote sensing or remote communication powers.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Banestrike
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +20.
Benefit: Any weapon the deity weilds gains a bonus of +4 on attack rolls, and it deals an extra +4d6 points of damage against the designated foe. The bonus and extra damage stack with any other properties the weapon has.
Notes: The deity selects one kind of enemy from the list below.
Aberrations
Oozes
Animals
Outsiders, chaotic
Beasts
Outsiders, evil
Constructs
Outsiders, good
Dragons
Outsiders, lawful
Elementals
Plants
Fey
Undead
Giants
Vermin
Monstrous humanoids
Humanoids (choose one subtype)
The ability functions only when the deity personally attacks with a melee weapon or ranged weapon. The deity can apply the Banestrike ability to any weapon or natural weapon, but not to a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or divine ability.
A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of foe each time. The deity can imbue only one bane special ability to a weapon at a time and can change among them once a round as a free action.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death, justice, vengeance, war.

Battlesense
Benefit: The deity cannot be surprised or flanked except by a deity of higher rank. The deity retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even if caught flat-footed or attacked by an invisible opponent, and is not subject to sneak attacks except by deities of higher rank.
Notes: If the deity has the uncanny dodge or improved uncanny dodge class feature, this ability replaces it.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: War.

Call Creatures
Benefit: The kind of creature the deity can call is noted in the deity’s description. Each creature called can have no more Hit Dice than the deity has divine ranks, and the deity cannot have more creatures serving it at any given time than the deity has ranks. The creatures are transported to the deity’s presence through an interdimensional connection similar to that created by a gate spell, except that it opens to the Material Plane. The creatures willingly serve to the best of their ability. The calling effect is otherwise similar
to the calling property of the gate spell.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of creature each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Clearsight
Prerequisites: Divine rank 6, Wis 29.
Benefit: The deity can see illusions, transmuted creatures and objects, and disguised creatures or objects for what they really are, provided they are within 10 feet per divine rank of the deity. This ability is similar to the true seeing spell, except that it does not reveal creatures’ alignments and it does foil mundane disguises.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Knowledge, truth.

Command Plants
Benefit: The deity can make plants grow in a radius of up to one mile per divine rank once per day. The deity can use this ability even in a place where no plants grow, though in this case the plants wither and die after one day. This ability works like the plant growth spell, except that it cannot be countered except by a deity of higher rank than the deity using the ability.
Also once per day, the deity can charm plant creatures, animate plants, or make them entangle its foes. This ability functions like the command plants spell, except that its maximum duration is one day no matter which option the deity chooses. At any one time, the deity can charm a number of plant creatures equal to its divine rank with this ability, regardless of Hit Dice.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Agriculture, earth, fertility.

Control Creatures
Benefit: The deity can command some kind of creature as noted in the deity’s description. This ability is similar to the dominate monster spell, but it is not a mind-affecting ability (the deity seizes direct control over the creature’s body). Each day the deity can attempt to control a number of creature equal to its divine rank. The deity can attempt to take control of that number all at once, or in smaller numbers. All creatures to
be affected must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. Once control is established, distance is not a factor and the deity can maintain control remotely, even across planes and through wards or barriers (except divine shields and warding spells cast by deities of higher rank than the deity using the ability). The subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s rank + the deity’s Charisma modifier) to resist and is allowed a
new save if the deity commands the subject to do something against its nature.
At any given time, the deity cannot have more creatures under its control than 10 times its divine rank. If the deity already has the maximum number of creatures under its control, it can still attempt to take control of other creatures, but must first release
one or more creatures already under its control.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of creature each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Craft Artifact
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Rod, Craft Staff, Craft Wand, Craft Wondrous Item, Forge Ring, Scribe Scroll.
Benefit: The deity can craft magic arms and armor, staffs, wands, wondrous items, rings, and scrolls that exceed the normal limits for such items
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Crafts, knowledge, magic.

Create Object
Prerequisites: Divine rank 6, Int 29.
Benefit: As a full-round action, the deity can create one or more simple, nonmagical objects with a total weight of up to 50 pounds per divine rank, or with a total volume of 10 cubic feet per rank. If the deity uses this ability on a divinely morphic plane or within its own godly realm, double the volume and weight the deity can create. If the deity’s realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, triple the volume and weight the deity can create there.
Notes: For purposes of this ability, a simple object can have no moving parts more complex than a door hinge and must be composed of a single material. The material can be no more valuable than iron (1 sp per pound). Once created, the objects are permanent and nonmagical. If the deity has the appropriate Craft skill, the deity can make a Craft
check when creating the item to make it a masterwork item.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Crafts, creation.

Create Greater Object
Prerequisites: Divine rank 11, Int 29, Create Object salient divine ability.
Benefit: As a full-round action, the deity can create objects weighing up to 100 pounds per divine rank, or with a volume of 20 cubic feet per rank. If the deity uses this ability on a divinely morphic plane or within its own godly realm, double the volume and
weight the deity can create. If the deity’s realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, triple the volume and weight the deity can create there.
Notes: This ability works like the Create Object ability, except as noted below. A deity can use this ability to create any kind of nonmagical object.
Rest: The deity must convert a considerable amount of its own energy into the object, which can leave the deity impaired. The deity can create an object with a value of up to 100 gp without impairment. For every additional 100 gp of value (or fraction of 100
gp), the deity must rest for 10 minutes. If the deity is creating an item on a divinely morphic plane or within its own godly realm, it can create a 200 gp item without resting. If the deity’s realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, it can create a 300 gp item
there without having to rest.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Crafts, creation.

Divine Air Mastery
Prerequisite: Air domain.
Benefit: The deity gains a competence bonus on attack rolls, damage, and Armor Class equal to its divine rank if both the deity and its foe are airborne. The deity can fly with perfect maneuverability. When flying, the deity can automatically know the location of
any corporeal creature within 10 feet per divine rank, by sensing the disturbance in the air the creature causes.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Air, wind.

Divine Archery
Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +20, Dex 29, Point Blank Shot, Far Shot.
Benefit: The deity can fire a ranged weapon at any target within line of sight and within range of the deity’s personal senses. No range increment applies to the attack. The deity does not incur any attacks of opportunity for firing a bow when threatened. As a full-round action, the deity may fire an arrow at her full base attack bonus at each opponent within 10 feet per divine rank. The deity must have the Weapon Focus feat with the type of bow she uses to perform this attack. When shooting a ranged weapon, the deity can ignore any cover bonus to the target’s AC or any miss chance conferred by the
target’s concealment.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Archers, war.

Divine Armor Mastery
Prerequisites: Armor Proficiency (light), Armor Proficiency (medium).
Benefit: The deity ignores the maximum Dexterity bonus limit for medium or light armor.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: War.

Divine Bard
Prerequisite: Bard level 20th.
Benefit: This ability has several benefits:
• For the deity’s bardic abilities that have a range (countersong, fascinate, inspire competence, inspire greatness), that range is a number of miles equal to the deity’s divine rank.
• The deity can use any bardic music inspiration ability as a standard action. The inspiration takes effect immediately after the deity concludes the action.
• The deity’s bardic music abilities can affect even those normally immune to mind-affecting effects. However, such creatures gain a +10 bonus on their Will saves to resist such effects.
• The effects of all the deity’s bardic music abilities are doubled. Inspire courage grants a +8 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +8 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls; inspire competence grants a +4 competence bonus on skill checks; inspire greatness grants +4d10 Hit Dice, a +4 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 competence bonus on Fortitude saves, and inspire heroics grants a +8 morale bonus on saving throws and a +8 dodge bonus to AC. The number of allies the deity can affect with inspire competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics doubles. When inspiring competence in multiple allies, the deity can choose different skills to inspire for different allies.
• The effects of the deity’s bardic music inspiration abilities last for ten times as long as normal after the deity stops singing. This has no effect on inspiration abilities that have no duration after the bard stops singing.
• When any effect that is subject to countersong (any spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like effect that has the sonic or language-dependent desriptor) occurs within the deity’s hearing, the deity can attempt a countersong as if it had prepared an action to do so.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Art, bards, beauty, dance, love, music, poetry.

Divine Battle Mastery
Prerequisites: Fighter level 20th, Combat Reflexes, Int 13, Dex 13, Dodge, Expertise, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, War domain.
Benefit: The deity can make an unlimited number of attacks of opportunity in one round. (The deity still can’t make more than one attack of opportunity against a single opponent in a round.) As a full-round action, the deity may make one melee attack at its full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. The deity does not incur any attacks of opportunity from this action.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Justice, vengeance, war.

Divine Blast
Prerequisite: Cha 29.
Benefit: The deity can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + its Charisma bonus. The ray created can extend up to one mile per rank (the deity chooses the length). Targets the ray strikes take 1d12 points of damage per rank of the deity, plus 1d12
points of damage per point of Charisma bonus the deity has. There is no saving throw, but the deity must make a ranged touch attack to hit a target. The deity can make the ray look, sound, smell, and feel like any-thing it desires. Despite the appearance of the ray,
the damage it deals results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from elements and similar magic.
Notes: The ray destroys a wall of force, prismatic wall, or prismatic sphere it hits (all layers in a prismatic effect are destroyed). The ray itself is unaffected and can strike a target behind the wall of force or prismatic effect.
A divine shield can stop the ray.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death, destruction, war.

Divine Blessing
Prerequisite: Selected ability score 40.
Benefit: Choose one ability: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. The deity must have a score of at least 40 in the selected ability. The deity can grant mortals a +6 enhancement bonus to that ability that lasts for one day. In a single day and at one time, the deity can affect a number of creatures equal to its divine rank.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different ability score each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Agility, beauty, endurance, knowledge, strength, wisdom.

Divine Celerity
Prerequisite: Dex 29.
Benefit: The deity acts as if hasted for a number of minutes per day equal to its divine rank. The duration of the effect need not be consecutive rounds. Activating this ability is a free action.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Travel, wind.

Divine Creation
Prerequisites: Divine rank 16, Int 29, Create Object salient divine ability, Create Greater Object salient divine ability.
Benefit: As a full-round action, the deity can create mortal creatures or magic items whose total weight is up to 100 pounds per divine rank, or with a total volume of 20 cubic feet per rank. If the deity uses this ability on a divinely morphic plane or within its
own godly realm, double the volume and weight the deity can create. If the deity’s realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, triple the volume and weight the deity can create there.
Notes: This ability works like the Create Greater Object ability, except as noted below.
A deity can use this ability to create any kind of creature that does not have a divine rank. The deity can create a creature with class levels, but never with more class levels than the deity has itself or the deity’s divine rank, whichever is lower.
Rest: The deity must convert a considerable amount of its own energy into a creature, which always leaves the deity impaired. The deity must rest for 10 minutes ×the creature’s Hit Dice ×the creature’s Challenge Rating for each creature created, with a minimum of 10 minutes per creature. If the creature has class levels, each level counts as an additional Hit Die.
The deity can create any kind of magic item except an artifact.
The rest requirement for creating magic items is the same as for the Create Greater object ability.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Crafts, creation, supreme.

Divine Dodge
Prerequisite: Dex 29.
Benefit: Any physical attack or individually targeted spell directed at the deity has a percent miss chance equal to 50 + the deity’s rank. Area effects that include the deity have a similar chance to be ineffective.
Notes: The ability is similar to the blink spell, except that it is defensive only and the deity does not move to the Ethereal Plane, but simply exits from reality for a brief moment. This ability never interferes with the deity’s own attacks. If an attack overcomes the miss chance, the deity still gets the benefit of a saving throw (if one is allowed).
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Agility, gambling, luck, protection.

Divine Druid
Prerequisites: Druid level 20th.
Benefit: While in a wild shape, the deity gains all the extraordinary and supernatural abilities of the creature whose form it adopts. In addition to animal forms, the deity can take the form of magical beasts or plant creatures. Some deities can assume additional forms. These are specified in the deity’s description.
The deity can assume the form of any animal, magical beast, or plant creature from Fine to Colossal in size.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Nature.

Divine Earth Mastery
Prerequisites: Earth domain.
Benefit: The deity gains a competence bonus on attack rolls, damage, and Armor Class equal to its divine rank if both the deity and its foe are touching the ground. The deity gains a burrow speed commensurate with its size (see Divine Characteristics), as well as the ability to glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. This burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. The deity has tremorsense, allowing it to automatically sense the location of anything within 10 feet per divine rank that is in contact with the ground. The deity has complete control over all things made of earth (including stone and metal). It can alter the form of any amount of earth as a free action. The deity can duplicate the effects of the stone shape, move earth, rusting grasp, transmute rock to mud, transmute mud to rock, and disintegrate spells, with any earth, stone, or metal object as a target. The deity can also transmute any object made of earth,
stone, or metal into a different kind of earth, stone, or metal. The deity can affect any object it can see, but no more than one object per round.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Earth.

Divine Fast Healing
Prerequisites: Con 29 or the fast healing special quality.
Benefit: The deity gains fast healing of 20 + divine rank. Lost limbs or body parts reattach instantly when pressed against the wound on the body.
Notes: This ability does not stack with the fast healing special quality.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, and its effects stack. A deity with two applications of this ability improves its fast healing by 40 + (divine rank ×2).
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Endurance, healing.

Divine Fire Mastery
Prerequisites: Fire domain.
Benefit: The deity gains a competence bonus on attack rolls, damage, and Armor Class equal to its divine rank if both the deity and its foe are touching fire or using weapons with the flaming or flaming burst special abilities.
The deity is immune to the effects of fire and heat.
The deity can automatically know the location of any corporeal creature within 10 feet per divine rank by sensing the disturbance in the ambient temperature that the creature causes.
The deity has complete control over all nonmagical fire and can duplicate the effect of any spell with the fire descriptor as a standard action.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Fire.

Divine Glibness
Prerequisites: Cha 29, Bluff 40 ranks, Trickery domain.
Benefit: As a full-round action, the deity can speak and convince others to take some course of action. This works like a mass suggestion spell cast at a level equal to 10 + the deity’s divine rank, except that it affects up to (10 + divine rank) creatures, no two of
which can be more than (10 ×divine rank) feet apart. The save DC is 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Commerce, lies, thieves.

Divine Inspiration
Benefit: The deity can enchant creatures to create a specific emotion. The deity can affect one creature per divine rank at once, and up to the same number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. The specific effects depend on the
emotional state induced.
Courage: The enchanted creatures become immune to fear effects and receive a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, skill checks, and Will saves.
Despair: The enchanted creatures are affected as by an improved version of the crushing despair spell: affected creatures suffer a –4 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, saves, and checks unless they make a successful Will save (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma modifier + deity’s divine rank). The effect lasts one day.
Dread: The enchanted creatures must make successful Wisdom checks (DC = the deity’s divine rank) to attack or fight. If the check fails, the creature flees in panic for 1d4 rounds. If the check succeeds, the creature does not have to check again for
10 minutes. The enchanted creatures also suffer a –2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, skill checks, and Will saves.
Frenzy: Frenzied creatures spend themselves in drinking, feasting, and dancing unless provoked or incited to violence. Frenzied creatures turn violent if they are attacked or perceive a threat to their safety. Frenzied creatures receive a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity, a –4 penalty to Wisdom, and a –2 penalty to AC. Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma modifier + deity’s divine rank) to resist the effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion.
Hope: The enchanted creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.
Rage: The enchanted creatures receive a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and a –2 penalty to AC. They are compelled to fight heedless of danger. Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma
modifier + deity’s divine rank) to resist the effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion.
Love and Desire: A love effect causes the target to fall in love with the specified creature, seeking every opportunity to be near that creature and making every effort to win the creature’s affection. A desire effect is similar, but the target seeks any opportunity to
become physically intimate with the specified creature. Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma modifier + deity’s divine rank) to resist the effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Divine Monk
Prerequisites: Monk level 20th.
Benefit: The deity’s unarmed strikes are treated as a magic slashing weapon with an enhancement bonus of +5 and the keen, lawful, and vorpal qualities. If the deity chooses, a particular attack can be bludgeoning instead of slashing, but the keen and vorpal qualities do not apply to that attack. Any unarmed attack the deity makes has a base damage of 2d12.
The deity can use the Deflect Arrows feat to deflect any ranged attacks (including spells that require ranged touch attacks) as if they were arrows. The deity can deflect any number of attacks in a single round. When the deity deflects any attack, the attack is reflected upon the attacker, using the deity’s base ranged attack bonus. When the deity deflects a spell, the spell’s level is added to the DC to deflect the attack.  The deity only gains the second benefit of this ability if he or she has the Deflect Arrows feat.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Law.

Divine Paladin
Prerequisites: Paladin level 20th.
Benefit: The deity’s aura of courage grants a +8 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects and extends to all allies within 100 feet of the deity.
The deity’s special mount, if any, gains the celestial template.
The deity can smite evil ten times per day, and gets an extra 3 points of damage per class level on a successful smite attempt.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Good, justice, law, nobility, war.

Divine Radiance
Prerequisite: Good alignment, Sun domain.
Benefit: The deity can shed light in a (10 feet ×divine rank) emanation from its body. This light counters and dispels all darkness effects (unless created by a deity of higher rank) and causes pain and damage to undead creatures, who take 2d8 points of damage per round with no save. As a full attack action, the deity can generate up to three rays of scorching light that can strike targets up to a number of miles away equal to the deity’s divine rank. Each ray deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 divine ranks. Undead take 1d12 points of damage per 2 divine ranks.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Good, light, sun.

Divine Rage
Prerequisite: Barbarian level 20th.
Benefit: This ability is similar to the barbarian’s rage ability (and it replaces the barbarian rage ability for the deity). The deity can activate this ability only after suffering damage from a weapon, and can use it a number of times per day equal to its divine rank. Once used, the ability lasts 1 hour (though the deity can end the rage at will). While raging, the deity gains +10 to Strength, +10 to Constitution, and a +5 morale bonus on Will saves. The deity’s spell resistance and energy resistances each increase by +10. The deity also can make one extra attack, at its full attack bonus, whenever it uses the full attack action. While raging, the deity suffers a –5 penalty to Armor Class and cannot perform acts that require patience and concentration, such as moving silently, casting spells, and using salient divine abilities.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Destruction, rage, strength, war.

Divine Ranger
Prerequisites: Ranger level 20th, Wis 25, Wilderness Lore 40 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 30 ranks.
Benefit: Any weapon the deity wields against one of its favored enemies is treated as a bane weapon against that creature type. Thus, its enhancement bonus is increased by +2 and it deals +2d6 points of damage.
The deity can follow tracks at its normal land speed. It treats all normal terrain as very soft ground for purposes of tracking and ignores DC modifiers for time or weather. The deity can track creatures across water, underwater, or through the air by means of the minute disturbances they make and traces of their passage. The table below adds across water, underwater, and air to the list of surfaces found in the Track feat description.
Surface
DC
Across water
60

Suggested Portfolio Elements: Archers, hunting, nature.

Divine Recall
Benefit: The deity remembers every event of a certain type that has ever occurred. The type of event is specified in the deity description.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different type of event each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Knowledge.

Divine Rogue
Prerequisites: Rogue level 20th, Dodge, improved evasion, defensive roll.
Benefit: When struck by an attack from an opponent the deity has designated as its dodge target, the deity may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + damage dealt) to negate all damage from the attack.
If the deity passes within 5 feet of a trap, the deity is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if the deity were actively looking for it.
The deity can assess the exact value of any treasure it can see.
The deity also can immediately determine what any creature is carrying and where each carried item is.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Thieves.

Divine Shield
Prerequisites: Cha 29.
Benefit: As a free action, the deity can create a shield that lasts 10 minutes and protects the deity’s body and equipment from attacks. The shield stops 10 points of damage per rank. Once the shield stops that much damage, it collapses. The damage can be from any source, including a divine blast attack. The deity can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + its Constitution bonus.
Notes: The deity can adjust the shield so that it does not block damage the deity ignores anyway. The effects of multiple divine shields do not stack.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Protection.

Divine Skill Focus
Prerequisites: 23 ranks in the selected skill.
Benefit: The deity receives a bonus of 10 + its divine rank when using the skill selected.
Notes: This bonus stacks with the divine rank bonus deities normally receive on checks. If the selected skill is related to the deity’s portfolio, add the deity’s rank to the maximum DC for a free action.
A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different skill each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Divine Sneak Attack
Prerequisites: Sneak attack +10d6, crippling strike.
Benefit: The deity’s sneak attacks deal an additional +3d6 points of damage.
Any attack of opportunity the deity makes is considered a sneak attack.
The deity can flank or catch flat-footed any opponent whose divine rank does not exceed the deity’s and can sneak attack that opponent. The deity cannot deal sneak attack damage to opponents that are immune to critical hits. Any time the deity inflicts damage with a sneak attack, that target suffers damage equal to the deity’s sneak attack bonus
damage on the deity’s next turn as well.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Thieves.

Divine Spell Focus
Prerequisites: Spell Focus, Greater Spell Focus.
Benefit: The deity chooses one school of magic. The save DC for any spell of that school increases by one-half the deity’s divine rank. This bonus overlaps (does not stack with) the bonus from Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different school of magic each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Magic.

Divine Spellcasting
Prerequisites: Spellcaster level 20th.
Benefit: The deity can cast spells whose effective level is above 9th. The number of spells per day the deity can cast of each spell level above 9th depends on the deity’s key ability score for spell-casting classes in which the deity has achieved 20th level, as shown
on Table: Divine Spellcasting. The numbers on that table represent one spell per day at each spell level above 9th in which it receives bonus spells from its key ability score, plus
bonus spells based on the key ability score. The deity can use these slots for spells prepared or cast with a metamagic feat, or for lower-level spells.
If the deity has achieved 20th level in a spellcasting class with fewer than nine levels of spells (such as bard, paladin, or ranger), the deity can also cast one spell per day of each level between the maximum normal spell level and 9th, plus appropriate bonus spells
of each level based on the deity’s key ability score. These spells are not shown on the table.
The deity also doesn’t incur attacks of opportunity for casting spells when threatened.
In addition, the deity receives the benefit of the Spell Focus feat on any spell it casts.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Magic.

Spell Slots Above 9th Level
The Divine Spellcasting ability grants deities access to spell slots above 9th level (which can be used to hold lower-level spells or spells whose level has been increased above 9th by the use of metamagic feats). The number of spell slots available to a deity depends on the deity’s key ability score (Intelligence for wizards, Wisdom for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers, and Charisma for bards and sorcerers), as shown on Table: Divine Spellcasting.
Even though the table only includes ability scores up to 61 and spell slots up to 25th level, the progression continues infinitely in both directions. For ability scores beyond 61, or for spell slots above 25th level, expand the table to follow the same patterns
as shown.
The numbers on this table include bonus spells that a deity receives for having a sufficiently high ability score, as well as one additional spell of each level at which the deity gains at least one bonus spell. This additional spell is one of the benefits of the
Divine Spellcasting salient divine ability.

Divine Splendor
Prerequisites: Divine rank 16, Cha 26.
Benefit: Any mortal who approaches within 10 feet per divine rank of the deity in its natural form dies immediately, with no saving throw.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Supreme.

Divine Storm
Prerequisite: Divine rank 11.
Benefit: The deity can surround itself with a vortex of holy or unholy force that manifests in different forms depending on the deity. The vortex extends from the deity in an emanation with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. The effect stops attacks with thrown weapons and projectiles (they fail if made by creatures inside the area, or targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area).
In addition, the force expels creatures whose alignment on the ethical (lawful-chaotic) axis is opposite the deity’s. If the deity’s ethical alignment is neutral (neutral good or neutral evil), the force does not expel any creatures. Affected creatures in the area must make Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) or be picked up and thrown out, regardless of size. Such creatures suffer 1d6 points of
damage for each 10 feet they travel. Creatures that make successful saves are not affected by the vortex for one day, although the vortex still stops their thrown weapons and projectiles. Creatures that fail their saves can attempt to reenter the area, but must attempt new saves.
The force damages creatures whose alignment on the moral (good-evil) axis is opposite the deity’s. If the deity’s moral alignment is neutral (lawful neutral or chaotic neutral), the force does not damage any creatures. Affected creatures in the area must make Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) each round or suffer 1 point of holy damage per divine rank. A successful save negates the damage, but the creature must save again the next round if it is still within the area.
Creatures whose alignment is diametrically opposed to the deity’s are subject to both effects.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: War.

Divine Water Mastery
Prerequisites: Water domain.
Benefit: The deity gains a competence bonus on attack, damage, and Armor Class equal to its divine rank if both the deity and its foe are touching the same body of water.
The deity gains a swim speed commensurate with its size (see Divine Characteristics).
At will, as a full-round action, the deity can create a devastating tidal wave of water. On land, the wave has effects similar to a flash flood: Creatures caught in the water must
make a Fortitude save (DC 15). Large or smaller creatures that fail the save are swept
away, taking 1d6 points of subdual damage per round (1d3 points on a successful
Swim check against DC 20). Huge creatures that fail are knocked down, while Gar-gantuan and Colossal creatures are checked. The wave destroys all wooden buildings and
25% of the stone buildings it comes into contact with. At sea, the tidal wave capsizes ships and crushes them to splinters. The wave affects a number of miles of coastland up to the deity’s divine rank.
When touching water, the deity can automatically sense the location of anything within 10 feet per divine rank that is in contact with the same body of water.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Water.

Divine Weapon Focus
Benefit: This ability works like the Weapon Focus feat except that the deity receives a bonus of +4 on attacks with the weapon.
Notes: This bonus stacks with the divine rank bonus deities get on attack rolls, and with the Divine Weapon Mastery salient divine ability. It also stacks with the Weapon Focus and Greater Weapon Focus feats.
A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of weapon each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: War.

Divine Weapon Mastery
Prerequisites: Fighter level 20th, War domain.
Benefit: The deity receives the benefits of the Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, and Improved Critical feats when wielding any simple or martial weapon.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: War.

Divine Weapon Specialization
Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +20, Divine Weapon Focus salient divine ability with the selected weapon.
Benefit: This ability works like the fighter’s Weapon Specialization feat, except that the deity receives a bonus on damage with the weapon equal to its divine rank.
Notes: If the selected weapon is a ranged weapon, the extra damage applies against any target the deity can see.
The damage bonus from this ability stacks with the damage bonus from the Divine Weapon Mastery ability and the Weapon Specialization and Greater Weapon Specialization feats.
A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of weapon each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: War.

Energy Burst
Benefit: The deity can create an emanation of a specific type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy, specified in the deity’s description) with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. Anything in the area takes 1d8 points of the appropriate energy damage per divine rank. Damage is halved for those who make successful saving throws (Reflex for acid, cold, electricity, or fire, or Fortitude for sonic energy; DC 10 + the deity’s divine rank + the deity’s Constitution modifier).
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different type of energy each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Nature.

Energy Storm
Prerequisite: Divine rank 11.
Benefit: The deity can surround itself with a vortex of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, positive, or negative energy, specified in the deity’s description). The vortex extends from the deity in an emanation with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. The effect
stops attacks with thrown weapons and projectiles. Such attacks fail if made by creatures inside the area, or targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area.
Energy storms that use acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy deal 1 point of energy damage and 1 point of holy damage per divine rank each round.
Positive energy deals 1 point of damage per divine rank to undead creatures, and heals the same amount of damage on living creatures.
Negative energy deals 1 point of negative energy per divine rank to living creatures, and heals the same amount of damage on undead creatures.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different type of energy each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Fire, storms.

Extra Domain
Prerequisite: Divine rank 6.
Benefit: The deity chooses one domain to add to its list of domains. The deity can grant spells and powers from that domain and use those spells and powers personally, just as it can the spells and powers of its other domains.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a new domain each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Extra Energy Immunity
Prerequisites: Divine rank 6, resistance to the energy type selected.
Benefit: The deity gains immunity to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy.
Notes: This ability is effective even if the attacker is a deity of higher rank.
A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different form of energy each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Extra Sense Enhancement
Prerequisites: Wis 29.
Benefit: The deity chooses one sense to enhance. The ability can extend a sense’s range one mile per divine rank, or it can allow the sense to ignore one type of physical or magical blockage. The enhanced sense can penetrate 10 feet of a physical barrier per rank or 100 feet of a less tangible barrier (such as fog or smoke) per rank.
Notes: Some deities have specific applications of this ability that go beyond the normal senses.
A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different sense each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Footsore
Prerequisites: Travel domain.
Benefit: The deity can sap the energy from living creatures so that they feel tired. It can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than one creature per divine rank each day. All must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. Subjects
can attempt Fortitude saves (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma modifier + deity’s divine rank). Creatures who fail their saves become fatigued and their speed is reduced by half. Furthermore, any mount or vehicle they ride is likewise slowed. The effect lasts one day.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Travel.

Free Move
Prerequisites: Dex 29, Divine Celerity salient divine ability.
Benefit: The deity can move up to its speed once a round as a free action.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Travel.

Frightful Presence
Prerequisites: Cha 24.
Benefit: Whenever the deity performs a specific action specified in the deity’s description (usually attacking, but sometimes making an intimidating gesture), foes within a 30-foot-radius burst must make Will saves (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma modifier + deity’s divine rank). Foes within the burst, but not the deity’s immediate target, become shaken for 3d6 rounds if they fail their saves. Creatures the deity attacks when it activates the ability become panicked for 3d6 rounds if they fail their saves. Foes who make successful saving throws are unaffected by this ability for one day.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Destruction, war.

Gift of Life
Benefit: The deity restores the dead creature to life, no matter how long the creature has been dead or what the condition of the body.
Notes: This ability works like the true resurrection spell, except that there is no material component and the amount of time the subject has been dead is irrelevant.
This ability can restore a creature to life against its will, but only with the permission of whatever deity rules the underworld or the divine realm where the mortal’s soul resides. This ability can resurrect an elemental or outsider and can resurrect a creature whose soul is trapped, provided the soul is not held by a deity of higher rank than the one using this ability.
This ability cannot restore life to a creature that has been slain by the Hand of Death ability or the Life and Death ability of a deity with a higher rank.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Healing, life.

Grow Creature
Benefit: This ability works like the animal growth spell, except that it can affect up to one creature of the specified type per divine rank each day, all of which must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. The effect lasts one day.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different type of creature each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Nature.

Hand of Death
Benefit: The deity points to any mortal within the deity’s sensory range and snuffs out its life. There must be an unbroken line of effect between the deity and the target.
Notes: This ability works like the destruction spell, except that there is no material component. The mortal is allowed a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 20 + the deity’s Charisma bonus + the deity’s divine rank. Even if the save succeeds, the subject takes 10d6 points of damage, which may kill it anyway. If the attack kills the mortal (either through a failed saving throw or through damage), the mortal cannot be raised or resurrected afterward, except by a deity of equal or higher rank using the Gift of Life, Life and Death, or Mass Life and Death salient divine ability.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death.

Increased Damage Reduction
Prerequisites: Con 29.
Benefit: The deity’s damage reduction increases 5 and adds an alignment requirement opposed to the deity’s alignment to bypass the damage reduction. For example, a lawful good deity with DR25/epic would gain DR 30/epic and evil or DR 30 epic and chaotic.
Notes: A deity cannot chose this ability more than once.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Increased Energy Resistance
Benefit: The deity gains resistance equal to its divine rank to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different form of energy each time. The deity also can have this ability more than once for a single type of energy. When applied to an energy type that the deity already resists, this ability increases the resistance by 10.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Any.

Increased Spell Resistance
Benefit: The deity’s spell resistance increases by 20.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, and its effects stack. A deity with two applications of this ability improves its spell resistance by 40.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Magic.

Indomitable Strength
Prerequisite: Str 40, Strength domain.
Benefit: If required to make an opposed roll involving Strength (including grapple checks), the deity receives a divine bonus of +25 on its roll. This bonus stacks with the normal divine rank bonus.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Strength.

Instant Counterspell
Benefit: When any spell is cast within the deity’s line of sight, the deity can counterspell it as a free action, provided that the deity is capable of casting the spell immediately or has it as a spell-like ability and makes the required Spellcraft check. The use of Instant
Counterspell counts against the normal number of free actions the deity is allowed each round.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Magic.

Instant Move
Prerequisites: Divine rank 6, Dex 29.
Benefit: As a move action, the deity can travel up to 30 feet per divine rank, as though using the dimension door spell, except that the deity never appears within a solid object and can act immediately after teleporting.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Travel.

Irresistible Blows
Prerequisites: Weapon Focus and Improved Critical with the selected melee weapon.
Benefit: When the deity makes a melee attack with the chosen weapon against a creature, resolve the attack as a melee touch attack (the weapon blow ignores armor and natural armor bonuses). If the weapon hits, the creature struck must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the deity’s Constitution modifier + the deity’s divine rank) or be stunned for 1d10 rounds.
The deity’s attacks with the chosen weapons are considered to be adamantine for purposes of bypassing damage reduction and hardness.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of weapon each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: War.

Irresistible Performance
Prerequisites: Perform 40 ranks.
Benefit: When the deity sings, plays a musical instrument, tells jokes, recites verse, or engages in any other type of performance as a full-round action, the deity has the option to create any of the following effects. The deity can use this ability a number of times per
day equal to its divine rank. It affects up to one creature per divine rank within a burst with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank, centered on the deity.
• Affected creatures become unable to take actions; instead, they dance, observe the performance with rapt attention, laugh, or applaud at the deity’s option. The affected creatures also suffer a –4 penalty to Armor Class, cannot succeed at Reflex saves (except on a roll of 20), and cannot use shields. Creatures can resist this mind effect with a successful Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank). The effects last for as long as the deity performs and for up to 1 round per divine rank thereafter.
• Affected creatures become blissfully calm. They are immune to fear and compulsion effects except for those created by deities of higher rank than the performing deity and any such effects already operating on affected creatures are countered and dispelled. This ability also counters and dispels rage effects except for those created by deities of higher rank than the performing deity. Immunity to fear and compulsion last for as long as the deity performs and for up to 1 round per divine rank thereafter.
• Affected creatures fall asleep. This works like the sleep spell, except that any living creature can be affected. Creatures can resist this mind effect with Will saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank). Affected creatures sleep for up to 1 hour per divine rank or until awakened. The deity can end the effect at will.
• Affected creatures are so deeply moved that they simply die. Only living creatures with Hit Dice equal to or less than the deity’s divine rank are affected. Creatures can resist the effect with Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank).
Once a creature makes a successful save against one of the deity’s performances, the creature cannot be affected again for one day.
Note: Not all deities with this ability can create all the mentioned effects, as specified in the deity descriptions.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Art, bards, beauty, dance, love, music, poetry.

Know Death
Benefit: The deity knows the exact moment and circumstances of any mortal creature’s death just by looking at the creature.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death.

Know Secrets
No secrets can be kept from the deity.
Benefit: The deity can learn a creature’s entire history (including any embarrassing or vital secrets it might know) just by looking at it. This ability is similar to the legend lore spell, except that it delivers instant results and the subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) to avoid the effect.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Knowledge, secrets.

Lay Curse
Benefit: This ability works like the bestow curse spell, except that mortals get no save. Deities of equal or lesser rank are subject to this ability, but are allowed Will saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) to resist. The curse
can be removed only by a deity of equal or higher rank than the cursing deity.
The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Evil.

Lay Quest
Benefit: This ability works like the geas/quest spell, except that it works only on mortals and it can be removed only by a deity of equal or higher rank than the deity who lays the quest. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Justice, law.

Life and Death
Prerequisites: Divine rank 6, Gift of Life or Hand of Death salient divine ability.
Benefit: The deity designates any mortal and snuffs out its life. Or the deity can designate any dead mortal and restore it to life.
Notes: This ability works across planar boundaries and penetrates any barrier except a divine shield. However, the subject must be in a location the deity can sense, either within the deity’s sense range or in a location the deity can perceive through its remote sensing ability. If the deity cannot see the subject, the deity must unambiguously identify the subject in some fashion. If the deity chooses to kill a mortal, the ability works like the
destruction spell, except that there is no material component or saving throw. The mortal cannot be raised or resurrected afterward, except by a deity of equal or higher rank using the Gift of Life or Life and Death salient divine ability.
If the deity restores life to a mortal, this ability works like the true resurrection spell, except that there is no material component and the amount of time the subject has been dead is irrelevant.
This ability cannot restore a creature to life against its will, but it can resurrect an elemental or outsider. It can resurrect a creature whose soul is trapped, provided the soul is not held by a deity of higher rank than the one using this ability.
This ability cannot restore life to a creature that has been slain by the Hand of Death, Life and Death, or Mass Life and Death ability of a deity with a higher rank.
Rest: After using either version of this ability, the deity must rest for 1 minute per level or Hit Die of the creature affected.
Deities whose portfolio includes death do not have to rest after using this ability.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death, supreme.

Life Drain
Prerequisites: Death domain.
Benefit: As a free action, the deity can generate a cloud of darkness that rises from its body in a spread with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank and 10 feet high. The cloud blocks sight as a deeper darkness spell does, except that it cannot be countered by light
effects (other than those cast by deities of higher rank). Living creatures must make Will saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) or die. Even with a successful save, living creatures still gain two negative levels (the save DC to remove the negative levels is the same as the first Will save). A single creature can be drained by the cloud only once per day, but the cloud’s darkness remains effective.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death, undead.

Mass Divine Blast
Prerequisites: Divine rank 6, Cha 29, Divine Blast salient divine ability.
Benefit: This ability works like the Divine Blast ability, except that the deity can specify up to five targets per rank, no two of which can be more than one mile apart per rank, or an area. The area can be a cone, burst, spread, or cylinder. A cone can be up to 100 feet long per rank. A burst or spread can have a radius of up to 50 feet per rank. A cylinder can have a radius of up to 50 feet per rank and a height of up to 10 feet per rank. The deity chooses the attack’s exact form and dimensions.
Each use of this ability counts as a use of the deity’s Divine Blast ability.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death, destruction, war.

Mass Life and Death
Prerequisites: Divine rank 16, Gift of Life or Hand of Death salient divine ability, Life and Death salient divine ability.
Benefit: The deity can designate any number of mortals and snuffs out their lives. Or the deity can designate any number of dead mortals and restore them to life.
Notes: No two mortals affected by a single use of this ability can be more than one mile apart per rank of the deity. The ability is otherwise identical with the Life and Death salient divine ability.
Rest: After using either version of this ability, the deity must rest for 1 minute per levels or Hit Dice of the creatures affected.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death, supreme.

Master Crafter
Prerequisites: 23 ranks in two different Craft skills.
Benefit: Any object the deity creates is treated as a masterwork item, but uses the base item price (not the masterwork price) to determine time and cost required to create it. Any item the deity creates also has twice the hit points it would normally have, and its
break DC is increased by +10. These benefits apply to walls, doors, and other components of buildings the deity creates, as well as smaller items.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Crafts, creation.

Mind of the Beast
The deity can make plants and animals sentient, and it can reduce sentient creatures to animal or plant form.
Benefit: The deity can grant humanlike sentience to trees or animals. This sentience lasts a maximum of one day, and the sentient tree or animal obeys the deity’s commands to the best of its ability. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected.
Also, the deity can transmute any creature into a plant or animal of approximately the same size or up to two size categories smaller. The subject is allowed a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) to resist. Subjects
turned into plants become objects. Subjects turned into animals have the same abilities and statistics of the kind of animal the deity chooses.
The Alter Reality ability can make either effect permanent.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Nature.

Possess Mortal
Prerequisites: Cha 29.
Benefit: The deity can possess any mortal in any location the deity can sense. Unwilling mortals can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s rank).
Notes: Spells that prevent possession block this ability if the mortal is unwilling. Likewise, spells that end possession drive out the deity if the mortal is unwilling. If the mortal is willing, however, the deity cannot be blocked or driven out, except by a divine
shield or the use of the Alter Reality salient divine ability by a deity of higher rank.
The possessed mortal effectively becomes an avatar of the deity. The deity can draw on all the possessed mortal’s memories, and the deity senses what the mortal senses. Each mortal possessed counts as a remote location where the deity is sensing and communicating. A demigod can possess up to two mortals at a time, a lesser deity can possess up to five mortals at once, an intermediate deity can possess up to ten, and a greater deity can possess up to twenty mortals at once.
While the deity is in possession, the mortal’s abilities are unchanged, except as noted below.
Type: Same as the deity.
Hit Points: Same as the mortal, +1 for each rank of the deity.
Armor Class: The mortal gains a divine bonus to Armor Class equal to half the deity’s divine rank.
Ability Scores: Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are unchanged. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma become 5 points lower than the deity’s (or remain as the mortal’s scores if they are higher).
Saves: Fortitude and Reflex same as the mortal; Will adjusted if necessary for the mortal’s new Wisdom score.
Skills: The mortal can use its own skills and the deity’s skills. If the mortal and the deity have the same skill, use the skill of whichever has more ranks in the skill. Use the mortal’s effective ability scores to determine skill modifiers.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Supreme.

Power of Luck
Prerequisites: Luck domain.
Benefit: The deity can give creatures good or bad fortune. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. Subjects receive a luck bonus of +1 per divine rank or a luck penalty of –1 per divine rank on attack rolls, saves, and checks for one day. Any creature that attacks the deity automatically suffers the luck penalty, and this does not count against the deity’s daily uses of this ability.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Fate, gambling, luck.

Power of Nature
Benefit: The deity can perform any of the following in a radius of one mile per divine rank around the deity, at will, as a full-round action.
• Create or quell winds to produce anything from still air to tornado force winds.
• Set the temperature anywhere from –50°F to 120°F.
• Shake the earth, as the earthquake spell.
• Create rain, sleet, hail, snow, or thunderstorms.
These effects last as long as the deity concentrates and for up to 1 minute per divine rank afterward. The deity can end an effect as a free action.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Nature, sea, weather.

Power of Truth
Benefit: The deity knows when anyone (other than a deity of equal or higher rank) deliberately lies. This ability works like the discern lies spell, except that it works continuously and applies to any creature the deity can perceive. The deity also can enchant creatures so they become truthful. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. The enchanted creatures become unable to utter any deliberate falsehoods or evasions of truth for one day. The subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) to resist. Subjects who make successful saves become immune to this ability for one day.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Justice, law, truth.

Rejuvenation
Prerequisites: Divine rank 11, Divine Fast Healing salient divine ability.
Benefit: When the deity suffers an attack that should destroy it, it simply disperses and reassembles later. Roll 10d10 to determine the number of days before the deity returns.
Notes: If the deity is killed in its own realm, subtract the deity’s divine rank from the number of days it takes to return. If the deity’s realm is on a divinely morphic Outer Plane, and the deity is killed there, subtract twice the deity’s divine rank from
the number of days it takes to return. The return always takes at least one day.
This ability is ineffective if the deity is killed by another deity of equal or higher rank.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death, life, undead.

See Magic
Prerequisites: Magic domain.
Benefit: This ability is similar to a constant greater arcane sight spell, except that it covers the whole area the deity can see, and the deity immediately knows the number of auras present along with their locations and strengths. The deity needs to make a Spellcraft check to identify the school of each aura, but most deities with this ability can use Spellcraft as a free action.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Magic.

Shapechange
This is an extraordinary ability.
Prerequisites: Divine rank 11, Alter Size salient divine ability,
Alter Form salient divine ability.
Benefit: The deity can assume the form of an animal, beast, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or plant. The assumed form must be both living and corporeal. The deity can remain in the assumed form indefinitely, but it resumes its own form if slain.
Notes: This ability works like the Shift Form salient divine ability, except that the deity is not limited to a set number of forms and as noted here.
The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously with this one to become as small as a grain of sand or as large as 1,600 feet in the assumed form’s greatest dimension.
The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +20 on its Disguise checks.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Nature, secrets, thieves.

Shift Form
This is an extraordinary ability.
Prerequisites: Divine rank 6, Alter Size salient divine ability, Alter Form salient divine ability.
Benefit: The deity can assume the form of another creature. The forms a deity can assume are limited and vary with each deity. The forms allowed are listed in the deity’s description. The deity can remain in the assumed form indefinitely, but it
resumes its own form if slain.
Notes: The deity acquires the physical, natural, and extraordinary abilities of the form it has assumed (but not spell-like or supernatural abilities) while retaining its own mind. Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, swoop and rake, and constriction; but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, energy effect, and the like), and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so on). A body with extra limbs does not allow the deity to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings. The deity’s speed is that of the assumed form or the deity’s normal speed, whichever is higher.
In general, any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original form. However, if the assumed form has an extraordinary ability that allows it to produce a substance or shed part of its body, then this ability also grants that ability.
The deity retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in its Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) The deity retains its outsider type, extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural abilities.
The deity also retains its divine Armor Class bonus and divine qualities and abilities, provided they are not supernatural.
The deity can cast spells for which it has components. It needs a voice like that of a humanoid for verbal components and hands like those of a humanoid for somatic components, Likewise, the deity needs hands to use many of its powers, such as creating objects related to its portfolio.
When the shape shift occurs, the deity’s equipment, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a creature that does not use equipment (aberration, animal, beast, magical beast, construct, dragon, elemental, ooze, some outsiders, plant, some undead creatures, some shapechangers, or vermin), the equipment melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.
Material components and focuses melded in this way cannot be used to cast spells. If the new form uses equipment (fey, giant, humanoid, some outsiders, many shapechangers, many undead creatures), the deity’s equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties.
This ability cannot confer class levels or class abilities.
The deity can change physical qualities such as hair color, hair texture, skin color, and gender. The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +15 on its Disguise checks.
The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously with this one to become as small as a grain of sand or as large as 1,600 feet in the assumed form’s greatest dimension.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Nature.

Speak with Creatures
Benefit: The deity has the supernatural ability to converse with the specified creature. This ability works like a permanent speak with animals or speak with plants spell, or like a tongues spell that only allows the deity to converse with the specified type of creature.
Notes: A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different type of creature each time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Nature.

Spontaneous Wizard Spells
Prerequisites: Divine rank 6, Wizard level 1st, Int 29, Spell Mastery, Arcane Mastery salient divine ability.
Benefit: This ability works like a cleric’s ability to cast cure spells spontaneously, except that it applies to wizard spells. The deity must have a sufficient Intelligence score and wizard levels to cast the spell.
Notes: The deity still needs a spellbook for its wizard spells unless it also has the Divine Spellcasting ability.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Knowledge, magic.

Stride
Prerequisites: Travel domain.
Benefit: The deity’s movement is doubled on the local or overland scales. Also, having this ability means that the deity’s height does not limit the distance it can jump.
In addition, the deity can impart extra overland speed to living creatures. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. Creatures who receive this boon double their speeds on the local or overland scales.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Travel.

Sunder and Disjoin
Benefit: If any weapon or item is used against the deity in combat, the deity can destroy it with a touch. Treat a successful touch as a combination of a disintegrate spell and a
disjunction spell, both targeted exclusively at the touched item. The save DC for both effects is 19 + the deity’s Charisma modifier. Anitem remains vulnerable to this ability for up to one day after being used against the deity.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Victory, war.

Supreme Initiative
This is an extraordinary ability.
Prerequisites: Dex 29, Improved Initiative.
Benefit: The deity goes first in the initiative order, no matter what its initiative result is or what initiative result anyone else in an encounter or battle has.
Notes: Determine initiative normally among any beings who don’t have this ability, placing them in order after the deity. The deity can choose to delay or ready an action, just any other being can, and doing so changes the deity’s initiative as normal. The deity also can refocus, thereby resuming its position at the beginning of the initiative order.
If two or more deities who have this ability are in the same battle, the deity with the highest divine rank gets the first position in the initiative order, the deity with the second highest rank gets the second position, and so on. Other beings then go in order after the last deity with the Supreme Initiative ability.
If two deities with this ability and the same divine rank are in a battle, make an initiative check for each deity, and the deity with the higher result goes first.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Agility, thieves, war.

True Knowledge
Prerequisites: Divine rank 11, Int 40, bardic knowledge or lore class feature and 10th level in the class that grants the ability, Knowledge domain.
Benefit: The deity never fails a bardic knowledge or lore check, no matter how obscure the knowledge involved. The deity speaks and understands all languages. The deity can use legend lore and analyze dweomer as free actions at will. These actions count against
the deity’s maximum number of free actions per round.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Knowledge.

True Shapechange
This is an extraordinary ability.
Prerequisites: Divine rank 16, Alter Size salient divine ability, Alter Form salient divine ability, Shapechange salient divine ability.
Benefit: The deity can assume the form of any object or creature. The deity can remain in the assumed form indefinitely, but it resumes its own form if slain.
Notes: This ability works like the Shift Form salient divine ability, except as noted below.
The deity can take any form, living or unliving, corporal or incorporeal. The deity gains the supernatural abilities of the assumed form.
The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +20 on its Disguise checks.
The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously with this one to become as small as a grain of sand or as large as 1,600 feet in the assumed form’s greatest dimension.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Nature, secrets, thieves.

Undead Mastery
Prerequisites: Divine rank 14, Cleric level 17th.
Benefit: The deity can automatically command or destroy any undead creature, as desired, as a free action, though this counts against the normal limit of free actions per round. The deity can do this as often as desired, but it can command no more than one
undead creature per divine rank (regardless of the creatures’ Hit Dice) at any one time.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death, life, undead.

Undead Qualities
Benefit: The deity gains the qualities of the undead type:
—No Constitution score.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, and death effects.
—Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Immune to damage to its physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), as well as to fatigue and exhaustion effects.
—Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence score, although it can be healed. Negative energy can heal undead creatures. The fast healing special quality works regardless of the creature’s Intelligence score.
—Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).
—Uses its Charisma modifier for Concentration checks.
—Not at risk of death from massive damage, but when reduced to 0 hit points or less, it is immediately destroyed.
—Not affected by raise dead and reincarnate spells or abilities. Resurrection and true resurrection can affect undead creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into the living creatures they were before becoming undead.
—Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death, undead.

Wave of Chaos
Prerequisites: Chaotic alignment.
Benefit: The deity can create a wave of mental force that extends from the deity in a spread with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. Creatures within the spread must make Will saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) or
be forced to act unpredictably. This ability works like a confusion spell cast by a sorcerer of level 10 + the deity’s divine rank.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Chaos.

Wound Enemy
Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +20.
Benefit: The affected weapon deals damage to a creature such that a wound it causes deals 1d6 points of damage per round thereafter in addition to the normal damage from the weapon. Multiple wounds from the weapon result in cumulative bleeding loss (two
wounds for 2d6 points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can only be stopped by a successful Heal check (DC 15 + the deity’s rank) or the application of any cure spell or other healing spell (heal, healing circle, and so on).
Notes: The ability functions only when the deity personally attacks with a physical weapon. The ability works with a ranged weapon, but not if someone else uses the weapon. The deity can apply to the ability to any weapon or natural weapon, but not to a
spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or divine ability. A deity can have this ability multiple times, and its effects stack.
Suggested Portfolio Elements: Death, pain, war.


FEATS
Deities can obtain the feats described here, in addition to any standard feats.

BLINDSIGHT,5-FT.RADIUS [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +4, Blind-Fight, Wisdom 19.
Benefit: Using senses such as acute hearing and sensitivity to vibrations, you detect the location of opponents who are no more than 5 feet away from you. Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though it you discern incorporeal beings.

DISGUISE SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Prerequisites: Bardic music, Perform 12 ranks.
Benefit: You have mastered the art of casting spells unobtrusively, mingling verbal and somatic components into its music and performances so that others rarely catch you in the act of casting a spell. Like a silent, stilled spell, a disguised spell can’t be identified through Spellcraft. Your performance is obvious to everyone in the vicinity, but the fact that you are casting a spell isn’t. Unless the spell visibly emanates from you or observers have some other means of determining its source, they don’t know where the effect came from. A disguised spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.

DIVINE MIGHT [DIVINE ]
Prerequisites: Str 13, turn or rebuke undead ability, Power Attack.
Benefit: As a free action, spend one of your turn or rebuke undead attempts to add your Charisma bonus to your weapon damage for 1 full round.

DIVINE VENGEANCE [DIVINE ]
Prerequisites: Ability to turn undead, Extra Turning.
Benefit: You can spend one of your turn undead attempts to add 2d6 points of sacred energy damage to all your successful melee attacks against undead until the end of your next action. This is a supernatural ability.

ENERGY SUBSTITUTION [METAMAGIC]
Prerequisites: Any other metamagic feat, Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks.
Benefit: You choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. When employing a spell with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic designator, you can modify the spell to use your chosen type of energy instead. The altered spell uses a spell slot of the spell’s normal level.
The altered spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time the feat applies to a different type of energy.

EXTRA MUSIC [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Bardic music.
Benefit: You can use your bardic music four extra times per day.
Normal: Bards without the Extra Music feat can use bardic music once per day per level.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times, adding another four uses of bardic music each time.

EYES IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +3, Wis 19.
Benefit: Attackers do not gain the usual +2 attack bonus when flanking you. This feat grants no effect whenever you are attacked without benefit of your Dexterity modifier to AC, such as when you are flat-footed or when you are the target of a rogue’s sneak attack.

FLEET OF FOOT [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Dex 15, Run.
Benefit: When running or charging, you can make a single direction change of 90 degrees or less. You can’t use this feat while wearing medium or heavy armor, or when carrying a medium or heavy load.  If you are charging, you must move in a straight line for 10 feet after the turn to maintain the charge.
Normal: Without this feat, you can run or charge only in a straight line.

HOLD THE LINE [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Combat Reflexes, base attack bonus +2.
Benefit: You may make an attack of opportunity against a chagin opponent who enters an atea you threaten.  Your attack of opportunity happens immediately before the charge attack is resolved.
Normal: You only get an attack of opportunity against a character that exits a square you threaten.

JACK OF ALL TRADES [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: You must be at least 6th level.
Benefit: You can use any skill untrained, even those that normally require training.

KNOCK-DOWN [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +2, Improved Trip, Str 15.
Benefit: Whenever you deal 10 or more points of damage to your opponent in melee, you make a trip attack as a free action against the same target.

PERSISTENT SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Prerequisite: Extend Spell.
Benefit: A persistent spell has a duration of 24 hours. The persistent spell must have a personal range or a fixed range. Spells of instantaneous duration cannot be affected by this feat, nor can spells whose effects are discharged.  You need not concentrate on spells such as detect magic or detect thoughts to be aware of the mere presence of absence of the things detected, but you must still concentrate to gain additional information as normal.  Concentration on such a spell is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  A persistent spell uses up a spell slot six levels higher than the spell’s actual level.

PLANT CONTROL [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Plant Defiance, ability to cast speak with plants.
Benefit: You can rebuke or command plant creatures as an evil cleric rebukes undead. To command a plant, you must be able to speak with it via a speak with plants effect, though it may do so mentally if desired. This ability is usable a total number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You use your highest caster level to determine the level at which you rebuke plants.

PLANT DEFIANCE [GENERAL]
Prerequisite: Ability to cast detect animals or plants.
Benefit: You can turn (but not destroy) plant creatures as a good cleric turns undead. When determining the result of a turning attempt, treat all destruction results as normal turning. Treat immobile plant creatures as creatures unable to flee. This ability is usable a total number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You use your highest caster level to determine the level at which you turns plants.

POWER CRITICAL [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Weapon focus (chosen weapon), base attack bonus +4
Benefit: When using the weapon you selected, you gain a +4 bonus on the roll to confirm a threat.
Special: A fighter may select Power Critical as one of his fighter bonus feats.
You can gain Power Critical multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it may be with a different weapon or the same weapon.  If you take it with the same weapon, the effects of the feats stack.

REACH SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Benefit: You may cast a spell that normally has a range of touch at any distance up to 30 feet. The spell effectively becomes a ray, so you must succeed at a ranged touch attack to bestow the spell upon the recipient. A reach spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level.

REPEAT SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Prerequisites: Any other metamagic feat.
Benefit: A repeated spell is automatically cast again at the beginning of your next round of actions. No matter where you are, the secondary spell originates from the same location and affects the same area as the primary spell. If the repeated spell
designates a target, the secondary spell retargets the same target if the target is within 30 feet of its original position; otherwise the secondary spell fails to go off. A repeated spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell’s actual level. Repeat Spell cannot be used on spells with a range of touch.

SACRED SPELL [METAMAGIC]
Benefit: Half of the damage dealt by a sacred spell results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from elements or similar magic. The other half of the damage dealt by the spell is as normal. A sacred spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level. Only divine spells can be cast as sacred spells.

SHARP-SHOOTING [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack bonus +3.
Benefit: Your targets only receive a +2 bonus to Armor class due to cover.  This feat has no effect against foes with no cover or total cover.
Normal: Cover normally gives a +4 bonus to AC.
Special: A fighter may select Sharp-Shooting as one of his bonus feats.

SUBDUAL SUBSTITUTION [METAMAGIC]
Prerequisites: Any other metamagic feat, Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks.
Benefit: When employing a spell with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic designator, you can modify the spell to deal subdual damage instead of the indicated type of energy damage. The altered spell uses a spell slot of the spell’s normal level.
The altered spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt.

SUPERIOR EXPERTISE [GENERAL]
Prerequisites: Int 13, Combat Expertise, base attack bonus +6.
Benefit: When you use the Combat Expertise feat to improve your Armor Class, the number you subtract from your attack and add to your AC can be any number that does not exceed your base attack bonus.
This feat eliminates the +5 maximum for the Combat Expertise feat.

Divine Ranks and Powers
-----------------------

DIVINE RANKS AND POWERS

Divine Ranks
Each deity has a divine rank. A deity’s divine rank determines how much power the entity has.

Rank 0: Creatures of this rank are sometimes called quasi-deities or hero deities. Creatures that have a mortal and a deity as parents also fall into this category. These entities cannot grant spells, but are immortal and usually have one or more ability
scores that are far above the norm for their species. They may have some worshipers. Ordinary mortals do not have a divine rank of 0. They lack a divine rank altogether.

Rank 1–5: These entities, called demigods, are the weakest of the deities. A demigod can grant spells and perform a few deeds that are beyond mortal limits. A demigod has anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand devoted mortal worshipers and may receive veneration or respect from many more. A demigod controls a small godly realm (usually on an Outer Plane) and has minor control over a portfolio that includes one or more aspects of mortal existence. A demigod might be very accomplished in a single skill or a group of related skills, gain combat advantages in special circumstances, or be able to bring about minor changes in reality itself related to the portfolio.

Rank 6–10: Called lesser deities, these entities grant spells and can perform more powerful deeds than demigods can. Lesser deities have anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands of worshipers and control larger godly realms than demigods. They also have keener senses where their portfolios are concerned.

Rank 11–15: These entities are called intermediate deities. They have hundreds of thousands of mortal worshipers and control larger godly realms than demigods or lesser deities.

Rank 16–20: Called greater deities, these entities may have millions of mortal worshipers, and they command respect even among other deities. The most powerful of greater deities rule over other deities just as mortal sovereigns rule over commoners.

Rank 21+: These entities are beyond the ken of mortals and care nothing for worshipers. They do not grant spells, do not answer prayers, and do not respond to queries. If they are known at all, it is to a handful of scholars on the Material Plane. They are called overdeities. In some pantheistic systems, the consent of an overdeity is required to become a god.25

Divine Characteristics
Most deities are creatures of the outsider type (usually with 20 outsider Hit Dice). All deities that are outsiders have all alignment subtypes that correspond with their alignment.  Unlike other outsiders, they have no darkvision unless noted in the deity description. Deities’ physical characteristics vary from deity to deity. A deity’s outsider type, along with its class or classes, determines its weapon proficiencies, feats, and skills. Deities have some or all of the following additional qualities, depending on their divine rank.

Levels: Most deities are 20 HD outsiders with 30 to 50 character levels as well. These additional character levels beyond an effective character level of 20th follow the rules for epic levels.
Character levels above 20th confer some, but not all, of the benefits of normal levels. Deities gain all the class features for all their levels. The deity also gains the normal Hit Die for that class, plus additional skill points as if the deity had a level in that class normally. The deity gains an ability bonus every four levels, and a feat every three levels.
Beyond character level 20th, deities’ attack and saving throw bonuses increase at new rates. Deities gain a +1 epic attack bonus at 21st level and every other level thereafter. No deity can have more than four attacks derived strictly from its base attack bonus.  Deities also gain a +1 bonus on saving throws at 22nd level and every other level thereafter.

Hit Points: Deities receive maximum hit points for each Hit Die.

Speed: Deities can move much more quickly than mortals. A deity’s base land speed depends on its form (biped or quadruped) and its size, as shown on the following table. Some deities are exceptions, with speeds faster or slower than the norm.
Size
Biped*
Quadruped**
Fine
20 ft.
60 ft.
Diminutive
30 ft.
70 ft.
Tiny

Colossal

180 ft.
*Or any form with two or fewer legs.
**Or any form with three or more legs.
Note: Use the Biped column for burrow and swim speeds for all deities regardless of form. Use half the value in the Biped column for climb speeds for all deities. Use twice the value in the Quadruped column for fly speeds for all deities capable of flying.

Armor Class: A field of divine energy encompasses a deity’s body, granting it a divine Armor Class bonus equal to its divine rank. This bonus stacks with all other Armor Class bonuses and is effective against touch attacks and incorporeal touch attacks.
Most deities (all those with 20 outsider Hit Dice) have a natural armor bonus of their divine rank +13. All deities also have a deflection bonus to their AC equal to their Charisma bonus (if any).
Deities who aren’t outsiders have their normal natural armor bonus + their divine rank.
Many deities have other Armor Class bonuses as noted in their individual descriptions.

Attacks: A deity’s Hit Dice and type and character level determine its base attack bonus. In addition to the figures for weapon attacks, this section of the statistics block also includes melee touch attack and ranged touch attack bonuses, to be used when the deity casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability that requires a touch attack to affect its target. A deity gets its divine rank as a divine bonus on all attack rolls. Deities of rank 1 or higher do not automatically fail on a natural attack roll of 1.
Bypassing Damage Reduction: As outsiders with alignment subtypes, the natural attacks of deities, as well as any weapons they wield, are considered aligned the same as the deity for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.

Always Maximize Roll: Greater deities (rank 16–20) automatically get the best result possible on any check, saving throw, attack roll, or damage roll. Calculate success, failure, or other effects accordingly. When a greater deity makes a check, attack, or save assume a 20 was rolled and calculate success or failure from there. A d20 should still be rolled and used to check for a threat of a critical hit.  This quality means that greater deities never need the Maximize Spell feat, because their spells have maximum effect already.

Saving Throws: A deity’s outsider Hit Dice and character level determine its base saving throw bonuses. A deity gets its divine rank as a divine bonus on all saving throws. Deities of rank 1 or higher do not automatically fail on a natural saving throw roll of 1.

Checks: A deity gets its divine rank as a divine bonus on all skill checks, ability checks, caster level checks, and turning checks. Lesser deities (rank 6–10) may take 10 on any check, provided they need to make a check at all. Intermediate and greater deities (rank 11–20) always get a result of 20 on any check, provided they need to make a check at all.
Deities and Synergy Bonuses: For every 20 extra ranks a deity has in a skill, the deity’s synergy bonus from the skill (if any) increases by +2.

Immunities: Deities have the following immunities. Individual deities may have more immunities. Unless otherwise indicated, these immunities do not apply if the attacker is a deity of equal or higher rank.
Transmutation: A deity is immune to polymorphing, petrification, or any other attack that alters its form. Any shape-altering powers the deity might have work normally on itself.
Energy Drain, Ability Drain, Ability Damage: A deity is not subject to energy drain, ability drain, or ability damage.
Mind-Affecting Effects: A deity is immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
Energy Immunity: Deities of rank 1 or higher are immune to electricity, cold, and acid, even if the attacker is a deity of higher divine rank. Some deities have additional energy immunities.
Deities of rank 1 or higher are immune to disease and poison, stunning, sleep, paralysis, and death effects, and disintegration.
Deities of rank 6 or higher are immune to effects that imprison or banish them. Such effects include banishment, binding, dimensional anchor, dismissal, imprisonment, repulsion, soul bind, temporal stasis, trap the soul, and turning and rebuking.

Damage Reduction: A deity has damage reduction as shown below
Divine Rank
Damage Reduction
Quasi-deity (0)
10/epic
Demigod (1-5)
15/epic
Lesser deity (11-15)
20/epic
Intermediate deity (11-15)
25/epic
Greater deity (16-20)
30/epic

If the deity also has damage reduction from another source this damage reduction does not stack with the damage reduction granted by divine ranks. Instead, the deity gets the benefit of the best damage reduction in a given situation. Whenever a deity has a second kind of damage reduction that might apply to an attack, that damage reduction is listed in parentheses after the damage reduction entry in the deity’s statistics block.

Resistances: All deities have at least the following resistances.  Individual deities may have additional resistances.
Energy Resistance: A deity has fire resistance of 5 + its divine rank.
Spell Resistance: A deity has spell resistance of 32 + its divine rank.

Salient Divine Abilities: Every deity of rank 1 or higher has at least one additional power, called a salient divine ability, per divine rank (see Salient Divine Abilities).

Domain Powers: A deity of rank 1 or higher can use any domain power it can grant a number of times per day equal to its divine rank (if the power normally can be used more often than that, the deity gets the greater number of uses). If a domain power is based on a cleric’s level (or one-half a cleric’s level), a deity with no cleric levels has an effective cleric level equal to the deity’s divine rank (or one-half the deity’s divine rank) for this purpose.

Spell-Like Abilities: A deity can use any domain spell it can grant as a spell-like ability at will. The deity’s effective caster level for such abilities is 10 + the deity’s divine rank. The saving throw DC for such abilities is 10 + the spell level + the deity’s Charisma bonus (if any) + the deity’s divine rank.

Immortality: All deities (even those of rank 0) are naturally immortal and cannot die from natural causes. Deities do not age, and they do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. The only way for a deity to die is through special circumstances, usually by being slain in magical or physical combat. Deities of rank 1 or higher are not subject to death from massive damage.

Senses: Deities of rank 1 or higher have incredibly sensitive perception. Such a deity’s senses (including darkvision and low-light vision, if the deity has them) extend out to a radius of one mile per divine rank. Perception is limited to the senses a deity possesses. A deity cannot see through solid objects without using its remote sensing ability or some sort of x-ray vision power.
Remote Sensing: As a standard action, a deity of rank 1 or higher can perceive everything within a radius of one mile per rank around any of its worshipers, holy sites, or other objects or locales sacred to the deity. This supernatural effect can also be centered on any place where someone speaks the deity’s name or title for up to 1 hour after the name is spoken, and at any location when an event related to the deity’s portfolio occurs.The remote sensing power can cross planes and penetrate any barrier except a divine shield (described in Salient Divine Abilities) or an area otherwise blocked by a deity of equal or higher rank. Remote sensing is not fooled by misdirection or nondetection or similar spells, and it does not create a magical sensor that other creatures can detect. A deity can extend its senses to two or more remote locations at once (depending on divine rank) and still sense what’s going on nearby.

Divine Rank
Remote Locations
1–5
2
6–10
5
11–15
10
16–20
20

Once a deity chooses a remote location to sense, it automatically receives sensory information from that location until it chooses a new location to sense, or until it can’t sense the location.
Block Sensing: As a standard action, a deity of rank 1 or higher can block the sensing ability of other deities of its rank or lower. This power extends for a radius of one mile per rank of the deity, or within the same distance around a temple or other locale sacred to the deity, or the same distance around a portfolio-related event. The deity can block two remote locations at once, plus the area within one mile of itself. The blockage lasts 1 hour per divine rank.

Portfolio: Every deity of rank 1 or higher has at least limited knowledge and control over some aspect of mortal existence. A deity’s connection to its portfolio gives it a number of powers.
Portfolio Sense: Demigods have a limited ability to sense events involving their portfolios. They automatically sense any event that involves one thousand or more people. The ability is limited to the present. Lesser deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios and affects five hundred or more people. Intermediate deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios, regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses extend one week into the past for every divine rank they have. Greater deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios, regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses extend one week into the past and one week into the future for every divine rank they have. When a deity senses an event, it merely knows that the event is occurring and where it is. The deity receives no sensory information about the event. Once a deity notices an event, it can use its remote sensing power to perceive the event.

Automatic Actions: When performing an action within its portfolio, a deity can perform any action as a free action, as long as the check DC is equal to or less than the number on the table below. The number of free actions a deity can perform each round is also determined by the deity’s divine rank.

Divine Rank
Maximum DC for Automatic Action
Free Actions per Round
1–5
15
2
6–10
20
5
11–15
25
10
16–20
30
20

Create Magic Items: A deity of rank 1 or higher can create magic items related to its portfolio without any requisite item creation feat, provided that the deity possesses all other prerequisites for the item. The maximum item value a deity can create is a function of its divine rank (see the table below). The item’s cost and creation time remain unchanged, but the deity is free to undertake any activity when not laboring on the item.

Divine Rank
Maximum Market Price
1–5
4,500 gp
6–10
30,000 gp
11–15
200,000 gp (any nonartifact)
16–20
No maximum (including artifact)

If a deity has the item creation feat pertaining to the item it wishes to create, the cost (in gold and XP) and creation times are halved.

Divine Aura: The mere presence of a deity of rank 1 or higher can deeply affect mortals and beings of lower divine rank. All divine aura effects are mind-affecting, extraordinary abilities. Mortals and other deities of lower rank can resist the aura’s effects with successful Will saves; the DC is 10 + the deity’s rank + the deity’s Charisma modifier. Deities are immune to the auras of deities of equal or lower rank. Any being who makes a successful saving throw against a deity’s aura power becomes immune to that deity’s aura power for one day. Divine aura is an emanation that extends around the deity in a radius whose size is a function of divine rank. The deity chooses the size of the radius and can change it as a free action. If the deity chooses a radius of 0 feet, its aura power effectively becomes non-functional. When two or more deities’ auras cover the same area, only the aura that belongs to the deity with the highest rank functions. If divine ranks are equal, the auras coexist.

Divine Rank
Divine Aura Size
1–5
10 ft./rank
6–10
100 ft./rank
11–15
100 ft./rank
16–20
1 mile/rank

The deity can make its own worshipers, beings of its alignment, or both types of individuals immune to the effect as a free action. The immunity lasts one day or until the deity dismisses it. Once affected by an aura power, creatures remain affected as long as they remain within the aura’s radius. The deity can choose from the following effects each round as a free action.
Daze: Affected beings just stare at the deity in fascination. They can defend themselves normally but can take no actions.
Fright: Affected beings become shaken and suffer a –2 morale penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks. The merest glance or gesture from the deity makes them frightened, and they flee as quickly as they can, although they can choose the path of their flight.
Resolve: The deity’s allies receive a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and checks, while the deity’s foes receive a –4 morale penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks.

Grant Spells: A deity automatically grants spells and domain powers to mortal divine spellcasters who pray to it. Most deities can grant spells from the cleric spell list, the ranger spell list, and from three or more domains. Deities with levels in the druid class can grant spells from the druid spell list, and deities with paladin levels can grant spells from the paladin spell list. A deity can withhold spells from any particular mortal as a free action; once a spell has been granted, it remains in the mortal’s mind until expended.

Spontaneous Casting: A deity of rank 1 or higher who has levels in a divine spellcasting class can spontaneously cast any spell it can grant.

Communication: A deity of rank 1 or higher can understand, speak, and read any language, including nonverbal languages. The deity can speak directly to any beings within one mile of itself per divine rank.
Remote Communication: As a standard action, a deity of rank 1 or higher can send a communication to a remote location. The deity can speak to any of its own worshipers, and to anyone within one mile per rank away from a site dedicated to the deity, or within one mile per rank away from a statue or other likeness of the deity. The creature being contacted can receive a telepathic message that only it can hear. Alternatively, the deity’s voice can seem to issue from the air, the ground, or from some object of the deity’s choosing (but not an object or locale dedicated to another deity of equal or higher rank than the deity who is speaking). In the latter case, anyone within earshot of the sound can hear it. The deity can send a manifestation or omen instead of a spoken or telepathic message. The exact nature of this communication varies with the deity, but it usually is some visible phenomenon. A deity’s communication power can cross planes and penetrate any barrier. Once communication is initiated, the deity can continue communicating as a free action until it decides to end the communication. A deity can carry on as many remote communications at one time as it can remote sense at one time (see Remote Sensing, above).

Godly Realm: Each deity of rank 1 or higher has a location that serves as a workplace, personal residence, audience chamber, and sometimes as a retreat or fortress. A deity is at its most powerful within its godly realm. A deity has at least modest control over the environment within its realm, controlling the temperature and minor elements of the environment. The radius of this control is a function of the deity’s rank and whether the realm is located on an Outer Plane or some other plane (including the Material Plane).

Divine Rank
——— Radius of Control ———

Outer Plane
Material Plane
1–5
100 ft./rank
100 ft./rank
6–10
1 mile
100 ft./rank
11–15
10 miles
100 ft./rank
16–20
100 miles
100 ft./rank

Within this area, the deity can set any temperature that is normal for the plane where the realm is located (for the Material Plane, any temperature from –20ºF to 120ºF), and fill the area with scents and sounds as the deity sees fit. Sounds can be no louder than one hundred humans could make, but not intelligible speech or harmful sound. The deity’s ability to create scents is similar. Deities of rank 6 or higher can create the sounds of intelligible speech. A demigod or lesser deity can erect buildings and alter the landscape, but must do so through its own labor, through magic, or through its divine powers. A deity of rank 6 or higher not only has control over the environment, but also controls links to the Astral Plane. Manipulating a realm’s astral links renders teleportation and similar effects useless within the realm. The deity can designate certain locales within the realm where astral links remain intact. Likewise, the deity can block off the realm from planar portals or designate locations where portals are possible. A deity of rank 11 or higher can also apply the enhanced magic or impeded magic trait to up to four groups of spells (schools, domains, or spells with the same descriptor). The enhanced magic trait enables a metamagic feat to be applied to a group of spells without requiring higher-level spell slots. Many deities apply the enhanced magic trait to their domain spells, making them maximized (as the Maximize Spell feat) within the boundaries of their realm. The impeded magic trait doesn’t affect the deity’s spells and spell-like abilities.
In addition, a deity of rank 11 or higher can erect buildings as desired and alter terrain within ten miles to become any terrain type found on the Material Plane. These buildings and alterations are manifestations of the deity’s control over the realm.
A greater deity (rank 16 or higher) also can perform any one of the following acts:
• Change or apply a gravity trait within the realm.
• Change or apply an elemental or energy trait within the realm.
• Change or apply a time trait within the realm.
• Apply the limited magic trait to a particular school, domain, or spell descriptor within the area, preventing such spells and spell-like abilities from functioning. The greater deity’s own spells and spell-like abilities are not limited by these restrictions.
Once a deity sets the conditions in its realm, they are permanent, though the deity can change them. As a standard action, the deity can specify a new environmental condition. The change gradually takes effect over the next 10 minutes. Changing astral links, planar traits, or terrain requires more effort, and the deity must labor for a year and a day to change them. During this time, the deity must spend 8 hours a day on the project. During the remaining 16 hours of each day, the deity can perform any action it desires, so long as it remains within the realm. The astral links, planar traits, and terrain remain unchanged until the labor is complete.

Travel: A deity of rank 1 or higher can use teleport without error as a spell-like ability at will, as the spell cast by a 20th-level character, except that the deity can transport only itself and up to 100 pounds of objects per divine rank. A deity of rank 6 or higher also can use plane shift as a spell-like ability at will, as the spell cast by a 20th-level character, except that the deity can only transport itself and up to 100 pounds of objects. If the deity has a familiar, personal mount, or personal intelligent weapon, the creature can accompany the deity in any mode of travel if the deity touches it. The creature’s weight counts against the deity’s weight limit.

Familiar: A deity of rank 1 or higher with levels as a sorcerer or a wizard has the ability to treat any creature of a given kind as a familiar, as long as that creature is within a distance of one mile per divine rank of the deity. This special familiar ability only applies to one creature at a time, but the deity can switch between one creature and another instantaneously, as long as the second creature is within range. This special familiar ability does not replace the deity’s ability to have a normal familiar, which could be any kind of eligible creature.
