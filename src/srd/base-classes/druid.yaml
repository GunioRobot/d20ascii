  Class Features:
    Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
      Level: 0
      Description: >
        Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger,
        dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. 
        They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and
        so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape.

        Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited
        from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather,
        or hide armor.  (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been
        altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were
        steel.  See the ironwood spell description) Druids are proficient
        with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.

        A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is
        unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or
        spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours
        thereafter.

    Spontaneous Casting:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that
        she hasn't prepared ahead of time.  She can "lose" a prepared spell
        in order to cast any summon nature's ally spell of the same level or
        lower.

    Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her
        deity's (if she has one).  Spells associated with particular
        alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law
        descriptors in their spell descriptions.

    Bonus Languages:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of
        woodland creatures.  This choice is in addition to the bonus
        languages available to the character because of her race.

        A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids,
        which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid.  Druidic is a free
        language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her
        regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language
        slot.  Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.

        Druidic has its own alphabet.

    Animal Companion (Ex):
      Level: 1
      Short: Animal Companion
      Description: >
        A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the
        following list\: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle,
        hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium
        viper), or wolf.  If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an
        aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available:
        porpoise, Medium shark, and squid.  This animal is a loyal companion
        that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its
        kind.

        A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind
        except as noted below.  As a druid advances in level, the animal's
        power increases as shown on the table.  If a druid releases her
        companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a
        ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer.  This ceremony
        can also replace an animal companion that has perished.

        A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of
        animals.  Should she select an animal companion from one of these
        alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the
        character's druid level were lower than it actually is.  Subtract
        the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the
        character's druid level and compare the result with the druid level
        entry on the table to determine the animal companion's powers.  (If
        this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or
        lower, she can't have that animal as a companion.)

    Nature Sense (Ex):
      Level: 1
      Short: Nature Sense
      Description: >
        A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.

    Wild Empathy (Ex):
      Short: Wild Empathy
      Level: 1
      Description: >
        A druid can improve the attitude of an animal.  This ability
        functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude
        of a person.  The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her
        Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.

        The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent,
        while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

        To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study
        each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one
        another under normal conditions.  Generally, influencing an animal
        in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might
        take more or less time.

        A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with
        an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the
        check.

    Woodland Stride (Ex):
      Level: 2
      Short: Woodland Stride
      Description: >
        Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of
        undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and
        similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or
        suffering any other impairment.  However, thorns, briars, and
        overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede
        motion still affect her.

    Trackless Step (Ex):
      Level: 3
      Short: Trackless Step
      Description: >
        Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural
        surroundings and cannot be tracked.  She may choose to leave a trail
        if so desired.

    Resist Nature's Lure (Ex):
      Level: 4
      Short: Resist Nature's Lure
      Description: >
        Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws
        against the spell-like abilities of fey.

    Wild Shape (Su):
      Short: Wild Shape (1/day)
      Level: 5
      Description: >
        At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any
        Small or Medium animal and back again once per day.  Her options for
        new forms include all creatures with the animal type.  This ability
        functions like the alternate form special ability, except as noted
        here.  The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she
        changes back.  Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard
        action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.  Each time you
        use wild shape, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for
        a night.

        Any gear worn or carried by the druid melds into the new form and
        becomes nonfunctional.  When the druid reverts to her true form, any
        objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same
        location on her body that they previously occupied and are once
        again functional.  Any new items worn in the assumed form fall off
        and land at the druid's feet.

        The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar
        with.

        A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she
        is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make,
        but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same
        general grouping as her new form.  (The normal sound a wild parrot
        makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)

        A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th,
        14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid.  In addition,
        she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th
        level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.

        The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level.

        At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into
        a plant creature with the same size restrictions as for animal
        forms.  (A druid can't use this ability to take the form of a plant
        that isn't a creature.)

        At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into
        a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water)
        once per day.  These elemental forms are in addition to her normal
        wild shape usage.  In addition to the normal effects of wild shape,
        the druid gains all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and
        spell-like abilities.  She also gains the elemental's feats for as
        long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own
        creature type.

        At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice
        per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day.  At
        20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a
        Huge elemental.

    Wild Shape 6:
      Level: 6
      Short: Wild Shape (2/day)

    Wild Shape 7:
      Level: 7
      Short: Wild Shape (3/day)

    Wild Shape 8:
      Level: 8
      Short: Wild Shape (Large)

    Wild Shape 10:
      Level: 10
      Short: Wild Shape (4/day)

    Wild Shape 11:
      Level: 11
      Short: Wild Shape (Tiny)

    Wild Shape 12:
      Level: 12
      Short: Wild Shape (plant)

    Wild Shape 14:
      Level: 14
      Short: Wild Shape (5/day)

    Wild Shape 15:
      Level: 15
      Short: Wild Shape (Huge)

    Wild Shape 16:
      Level: 16
      Short: Wild Shape (elemental 1/day)

    Wild Shape 18:
      Level: 18
      Short: Wild Shape (6/day, elemental 2/day)

    Wild Shape 20:
      Level: 20
      Short: Wild Shape (elemental 3/day, Huge elemental)

    Venom Immunity (Ex):
      Level: 9
      Short: Venom Immunity
      Description: >
        At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.

    A Thousand Faces (Su):
      Level: 13
      Short: A Thousand Faces
      Description: >
        At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at
        will, as if using the disguise self spell, but only while in her
        normal form.  This affects the druid's body but not her possessions. 
        It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the
        druid's appearance, within the limits described for the spell.

    Timeless Body (Ex):
      Level: 15
      Short: Timeless Body
      Description: >
        After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score
        penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged.  Any penalties she
        may have already incurred, however, remain in place.

        Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her
        time is up.

  Ex:
    Name: Ex-Druids
    Description: >
      A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited
      alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all
      spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not
      including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies).  She cannot
      thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the atonement
      spell description).
