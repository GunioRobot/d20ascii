  Class Features:
    Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
      Level: 0
      Description: >
        A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword,
        rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip.  Bards are proficient
        with light armor and shields (except tower shields).  A bard can
        cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the
        normal arcane spell failure chance.  However, like any other arcane
        spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield
        incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has
        a somatic component (most do).  A multiclass bard still incurs the
        normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from
        other classes.

    Spells:
      Level: 0    
      Description: >
        A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell
        list.  He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of
        time.  Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting,
        or music).  To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma
        score equal to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty Class
        for a saving throw against a bard's spell is 10 + the spell level +
        the bard's Charisma modifier.
        
        Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of
        spells of each spell level per day.  His base daily spell allotment
        is given on Table: The Bard.  In addition, he receives bonus spells
        per day if he has a high Charisma score.  When Table: The Bard
        indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell
        level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based
        on his Charisma score for that spell level.
        
        The bard's selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins
        play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice.  At most new bard
        levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: The
        Bard.  (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is
        not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: The Bard
        are fixed.)
        
        Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that
        (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in
        place of one he already knows.  In effect, the bard "loses" the old
        spell in exchange for the new one.  The new spell's level must be
        the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at
        least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard
        can cast.  A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level,
        and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time
        that he gains new spells known for the level.
        
        As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He
        can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet
        used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.
        
    Bardic Knowledge:
      Level: 1
      Short: Bardic Knowledge
      Description: >
        A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places.  (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)
        
        A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function.  A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random.
        
        .Bardic Knowledge

        [options="header",cols="1,1"]

        |=====

        | DC | Type of Knowledge

        | 10 | Common, known by at least a substantial minority of the local population.

        | 20 | Uncommon but available, known by only a few people legends.

        | 25 | Obscure, known by few, hard to come by.

        | 30 | Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don't understand the significance of the knowledge.

        |=====
        
    Bardic Music:
      Short: Bardic Music
      Level: 1
      Description: >
        Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to
        produce magical effects on those around him (usually including
        himself, if desired).  While these abilities fall under the category
        of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing
        instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting,
        singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an
        instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken
        performance.  Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a
        minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard
        does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform
        skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires
        the needed ranks.
        
        Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic
        music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must
        take a standard action each round to maintain the ability.  Even
        while using bardic music that doesn't require concentration, a bard
        cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such
        as scrolls), spell trigger (such as wands), or command word.  Just
        as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a
        20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music.  If he
        fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.
        
    Countersong (Su):
      Level: 1
      Short: Countersong
      Description:
        A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or
        poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not
        spells that simply have verbal components).  Each round of the
        countersong, he makes a Perform check.  Any creature within 30 feet
        of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic
        or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform
        check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw
        is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher.  If a
        creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect
        of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it
        gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears
        the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for
        the save.  Countersong has no effect against effects that don't
        allow saves.  The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.
        
    Fascinate (Sp):
      Level: 1
      Short: Fascinate
      Description:
        A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or
        poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with
        him.  Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to
        see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him.  The bard
        must also be able to see the creature.  The distraction of a nearby
        combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working.  For
        every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one
        additional creature with a single use of this ability.
        
        To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result
        is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. 
        If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to
        fascinate that creature again for 24 hours.  If its saving throw
        fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no
        other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and
        concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level).  While
        fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as
        reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks.  Any potential threat
        requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the
        creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform
        check result.
        
        Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a
        spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks
        the effect.  Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion),
        mind-affecting ability.
        
    Inspire Courage 8:
      Level: 8
      Short: Inspire Courage +2

    Inspire Courage 14:
      Level: 14
      Short: Inspire Courage +3

    Inspire Courage 20:
      Level: 20
      Short: Inspire Courage +4

    Inspire Courage (Su):
      Level: 1
      Short: Inspire Courage +1
      Description:
        A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or
        poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself),
        bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. 
        To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing.  The
        effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5
        rounds thereafter.  An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on
        saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus
        on attack and weapon damage rolls.  At 8th level, and every six bard
        levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th,
        and +4 at 20th).  Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.
        
    Inspire Competence (Su):
      Level: 3
      Short: Inspire Competence
      Description:
        A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform
        skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a
        task.  The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the
        bard.  The bard must also be able to see the ally.
        
        The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a
        particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard's
        music.  Certain uses of this ability are infeasible.  The effect
        lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2
        minutes.  A bard can't inspire competence in himself.  Inspire
        competence is a mind-affecting ability.
        
    Suggestion (Sp):
      Level: 6
      Short: Suggestion
      Description:
        A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform
        skill can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has
        already fascinated.  Using this ability does not break the bard's
        concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second
        saving throw against the fascinate effect.
        
        Making a suggestion doesn't count against a bard's daily limit on
        bardic music performances.  A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard's
        level + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect.  This ability
        affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). 
        Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language
        dependent ability.
        
    Inspire Greatness (Su):
      Level: 9
      Short: Inspire Greatness
      Description:
        A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform
        skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a
        single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra
        fighting capability.  For every three levels a bard attains beyond
        9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this
        ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th).  To
        inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. 
        The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for
        5 rounds thereafter.  A creature inspired with greatness gains 2
        bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit
        points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these
        bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1
        competence bonus on Fortitude saves.  The bonus Hit Dice count as
        regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit
        Dice dependant.  Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.
        
    Song of Freedom (Sp):
      Level: 12
      Short: Song of Freedom
      Description:
        A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform
        skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the
        break enchantment spell (caster level equals the character's bard
        level).  Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted
        concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within
        30 feet.  A bard can't use song of freedom on himself.
        
    Inspire Heroics (Su):
      Level: 15
      Short: Inspire Heroics
      Description:
        A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform
        skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in
        himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet.  For every three
        bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire
        heroics in one additional creature.  To inspire heroics, a bard must
        sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round.  A
        creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a
        +4 dodge bonus to AC.  The effect lasts for as long as the ally
        hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter.  Inspire
        heroics is a mind-affecting ability.
        
    Mass Suggestion (Sp):
      Level: 18
      Short: Mass Suggestion
      Description:
        This ability functions like suggestion, above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated. Mass suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.

      The bardic sage must be neutral good, neutral, or neutral evil. The
      true pursuit of knowledge cares little for ethical extremes.  A bardic
      sage who becomes chaotic or lawful cannot progress in levels as a
      bardic sage, though he retains all his bardic sage abilities.
      
      Base Save Bonuses
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The bardic sage has good will saves, but has poor Fortitude and Reflex
      saves.
      
      Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The bardic sage has all the standard bard class features, except as
      noted below.
      
      *Spellcasting:*
      A bardic sage learns and casts spells as a normal bard, with a few
      exceptions.  In addition to the normal number of spells known, a
      bardic sage knows one divination spell of each spell level he is
      capable of casting.  For example, a 1st-level bardic sage knows four
      0-level bard spells plus one 0-level bard spell of the divination
      school (such as detect magic, know direction, or read magic.  The
      bardic sage's number of spells per day does not change.
      
      To learn or cast a spell, a bardic sage must have an Intelligence
      score (not Charisma score) equal to at least 10 + the spell level. 
      All other spellcasting factors, including bonus spells and save DCs,
      are still determined using the bardic sage's Charisma score.  Add the
      following spells to the bardic sage's class spell list: 1st-detect
      chaos/evil/good/law; 2nd-zone of truth; 3rd-arcane sight; 4th-analyze
      dweomer (lowered from 6th), sending; 5th-contact other plane, greater
      scrying (lowered from 6th); 6th-true seeing, vision.
      
      *Bardic Knowledge:*
      A bardic sage gains a +2 bonus on all bardic knowledge checks.
      
      *Bardic Music:*
      A bardic sage's powers of inspiration are not as persistent as those
      of a traditional bard.  His ability to inspire courage, inspire
      greatness, or inspire heroics lasts only 3 rounds after the ally can
      no longer hear the bardic sage sing, rather than the normal 5 rounds.

      Not all bards are arcanists; some derive their special powers from a
      divine tradition.  In many primitive cultures, the divine bard takes
      the place of the cleric or the adept as the guide of the people's
      religious beliefs.
      
      Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The divine bard has all the standard bard class features, except as
      noted below.
      
      *Spellcasting:*
      A divine bard learns and casts spells as a normal bard, with some
      minor exceptions.  A divine bard's spells are divine spells, not
      arcane spells.
      
      To learn or cast a spell, a divine bard must have a Wisdom score (not
      Charisma score) equal to at least 10 + the spell level.  All other
      Spellcasting factors, including bonus spells and save DCs, are still
      determined using the divine bard's Charisma score.
      
      Like druids, paladins, and rangers, divine bards need not designate a
      specific deity as the source of their spells.  However, a divine bard
      can't cast spells of an alignment that doesn't match his.  Thus,
      divine bards cannot cast lawful spells (since bards can't be lawful). 
      Neutral divine bards can't cast any spells associated with an
      alignment (and are thus relatively rare).
      
      Add the following spells to the divine bard's class spell list:
      0-create water, cure minor wounds; 1st-detect evil/good/law,
      protection from evil/good/law; 2nd-consecrate, desecrate, gentle
      repose; 3rd-magic circle against evil/good/law, prayer; 4th-remove
      disease, speak with dead, sending; 5th-divination, restoration;
      6th-commune, hallow, unhallow, raise dead.

      The savage bard is a warrior at heart, though his arcane powers strike
      fear into the enemies of his tribe.  Savage bards often multi-class as
      barbarians to improve their combat prowess.
      
      *Alignment:*
      A savage bard must be chaotic in alignment. A savage bard who becomes
      nonchaotic cannot progress in levels as a bard, though he retains all
      his bard abilities.
      
      *Base Save Bonuses:*
      A savage bard has good Fortitude and Will saves, but has poor Reflex
      saves.
      
      *Class Skills:*
      A savage bard loses Decipher Script and Speak Language as class
      skills.  He adds Survival to his list of class skills.
      
      Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The savage bard has all the standard bard class features, except as
      noted below.
      
      *Illiteracy:*
      A savage bard is illiterate, just as a barbarian is. An illiterate
      savage bard cannot use or scribe scrolls.
      
      *Spellcasting:*
      Remove the following spells from the savage bard's class spell list:
      calm emotions, comprehend languages, detect secret doors, erase,
      prestidigitation, read magic, sepia snake sigil, summon monster (I
      through VI).
      
      Add the following spells to the savage bard's class spell list:
      1st-calm animals, detect snares and pits, endure elements, summon
      nature's ally I; 2nd-bull's strength, pass without trace, summon
      nature's ally II; 3rd-snare, summon nature's ally III; 4th-insect
      plague, summon nature's ally IV; 5th-commune with nature, summon
      nature's ally V; 6th-creeping doom, reincarnate, summon nature's ally
      VI.

      A rare bard might display a special link to nature and the mysterious
      world of the fey.  Such characters tend to be more aloof and less
      inspiring than standard bards.
      
      *Gain:*
      Animal companion (as druid), nature sense (as druid), resist nature's
      lure (as druid), wild empathy (as druid).
      
      *Lose:* Bardic knowledge, inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire
      greatness, inspire heroics.
