  Class Features:
    Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
      Level: 0
      Short: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
      Description:
        Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not
        proficient with any type of armor or shield.  Armor of any type
        interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which can cause his spells
        with somatic components to fail.
    
    Spells:
      Level: 0
      Description: >
        A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the
        sorcerer/wizard spell list.  He can cast any spell he knows without
        preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see
        below).
    
        To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score
        equal to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty Class for a
        saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level +
        the sorcerer's Charisma modifier.
    
        Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number
        of spells of each spell level per day.  His base daily spell
        allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer.  In addition, he receives
        bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.
    
        A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer
        begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of
        your choice.  At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new
        spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.  (Unlike
        spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not
        affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer
        Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells
        chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual
        spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. 
        The sorcerer can't use this method of spell acquisition to learn
        spells at a faster rate, however.
    
        Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level
        after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a
        new spell in place of one he already knows.  In effect, the sorcerer
        "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one.  The new spell's
        level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it
        must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer
        spell the sorcerer can cast.  A sorcerer may swap only a single
        spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the
        spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.
    
        Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells
        in advance.  He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he
        has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level.  He
        does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he'll cast.
    
    Arcane Spells And Armor:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        Wizards and sorcerers do not know how to wear armor effectively.
    
        If desired, they can wear armor anyway (though they'll be clumsy in it),
        or they can gain training in the proper use of armor (with the various
        Armor Proficiency feats-light, medium, and heavy-and the Shield
        Proficiency feat), or they can multiclass to add a class that grants
        them armor proficiency.  Even if a wizard or sorcerer is wearing armor
        with which he or she is proficient, however, it might still interfere
        with spellcasting.
    
        Armor restricts the complicated gestures that a wizards or sorcerer must make while casting any spell that has a somatic component (most do). The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.
    
        By contrast, bards not only know how to wear light armor effectively, but they can also ignore the arcane spell failure chance for such armor. A bard wearing armor heavier than light or using any type of shield incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance, even if he becomes proficient with that armor.
    
        If a spell doesn't have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can
        cast it with no problem while wearing armor.  Such spells can also be
        cast even if the caster's hands are bound or if he or she is grappling
        (although Concentration checks still apply normally).  Also, the
        metamagic feat Still Spell allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a
        spell at one spell level higher than normal without the somatic
        component.  This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor
        without risking arcane spell failure.

    Familiar:
      Level: 1
      Short: Summon Familiar
      Description:
        A sorcerer can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses
        up magical materials that cost 100 gp.  A familiar is a magical
        beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and
        intelligent.  The creature serves as a companion and servant.
    
        The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer
        advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.
    
        If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer
        must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw.  Failure means he loses
        200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss
        to one-half that amount.  However, a sorcerer's experience point
        total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or
        dismissal.  A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a
        year and day.  A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as
        a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution
        point when this happy event occurs.
    
        A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have
        only one familiar at a time.

    A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a
    magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard.  It
    retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses,
    skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as
    a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that
    depends on its type.  Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a
    familiar.  An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.

    A familiar also grants special abilities to its master (a sorcerer or
    wizard), as given on the table below.  These special abilities apply
    only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.

    Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the
    purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the
    master's level.

    Familiar Basics
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar's kind, but make the following changes:

    _Hit Dice:_
    For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal HD total, whichever is higher.

    _Hit Points:_
    The familiar has one-half the master's total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.

    _Attacks:_ Use the master's base attack bonus, as calculated from all
    his classes.  Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier,
    whichever is greater, to get the familiar's melee attack bonus with
    natural weapons.

    Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.

    _Saving Throws:_ For each saving throw, use either the familiar's base
    save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master's (as
    calculated from all his classes), whichever is better.  The familiar
    uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the
    other bonuses that the master might have on saves.

    _Skills:_ For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has
    ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or
    the master's skill ranks, whichever are better.  In either case, the
    familiar uses its own ability modifiers.  Regardless of a familiar's
    total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's
    ability to use.

    Familiar Ability Descriptions
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    All familiars have special abilities
    (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master's
    combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table
    below.  The abilities given on the table are cumulative.

    _Natural Armor Adj.:_ The number noted here is an improvement to the
    familiar's existing natural armor bonus.

    _Int:_
    The familiar's Intelligence score.

    _Alertness (Ex):_
    While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master gains the Alertness feat.
    
    _Improved Evasion (Ex):_ When subjected to an attack that normally
    allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage
    if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving
    throw fails.
    
    _Share Spells:_ At the master's option, he may have any spell (but not
    any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his familiar. 
    The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the
    benefit.
    
    If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops
    affecting the familiar if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not
    affect the familiar again even if it returns to the master before the
    duration expires.  Additionally, the master may cast a spell with a
    target of "You" on his familiar (as a touch range spell) instead of on
    himself.
    
    A master and his familiar can share spells even if the spells normally
    do not affect creatures of the familiar's type (magical beast).
    
    _Empathic Link (Su):_ The master has an empathic link with his familiar
    out to a distance of up to 1 mile.  The master cannot see through the
    familiar's eyes, but they can communicate empathically.  Because of the
    limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be
    communicated.
    
    Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an
    item or place that his familiar does.
    
    _Deliver Touch Spells (Su):_ If the master is 3rd level or higher, a
    familiar can deliver touch spells for him.  If the master and the
    familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he
    can designate his familiar as the "toucher." The familiar can then
    deliver the touch spell just as the master could.  As usual, if the
    master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch
    spell dissipates.
    
    _Speak with Master (Ex):_ If the master is 5th level or higher, a
    familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a
    common language.  Other creatures do not understand the communication
    without magical help.
    
    _Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex):_ If the master is 7th level or
    higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the
    same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats
    with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds,
    lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with
    similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks,
    wolverines, and badgers).  Such communication is limited by the
    intelligence of the conversing creatures.
    
    _Spell Resistance (Ex):_ If the master is 11th level or higher, a
    familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5.  To
    affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result
    on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the
    familiar's spell resistance.
    
    _Scry on Familiar (Sp):_ If the master is 13th level or higher, he may
    scry on his familiar (as if casting the scrying spell) once per day.
