  Class Features:
    Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
      Level: 0
      Short: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
      Description:
        Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not
        proficient with any type of armor or shield.  Armor of any type
        interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which can cause his spells
        with somatic components to fail.
    
    Spells:
      Level: 0
      Description: >
        A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the
        sorcerer/wizard spell list.  He can cast any spell he knows without
        preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see
        below).
    
        To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score
        equal to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty Class for a
        saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level +
        the sorcerer's Charisma modifier.
    
        Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number
        of spells of each spell level per day.  His base daily spell
        allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer.  In addition, he receives
        bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.
    
        A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer
        begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of
        your choice.  At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new
        spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.  (Unlike
        spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not
        affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer
        Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells
        chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual
        spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. 
        The sorcerer can't use this method of spell acquisition to learn
        spells at a faster rate, however.
    
        Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level
        after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a
        new spell in place of one he already knows.  In effect, the sorcerer
        "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one.  The new spell's
        level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it
        must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer
        spell the sorcerer can cast.  A sorcerer may swap only a single
        spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the
        spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.
    
        Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells
        in advance.  He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he
        has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level.  He
        does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he'll cast.
    
    Familiar:
      Level: 1
      Short: Summon Familiar
      Description:
        A sorcerer can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses
        up magical materials that cost 100 gp.  A familiar is a magical
        beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and
        intelligent.  The creature serves as a companion and servant.
    
        The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer
        advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.
    
        If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer
        must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw.  Failure means he loses
        200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss
        to one-half that amount.  However, a sorcerer's experience point
        total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or
        dismissal.  A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a
        year and day.  A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as
        a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution
        point when this happy event occurs.
    
        A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have
        only one familiar at a time.
