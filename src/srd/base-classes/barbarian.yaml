    Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
      Level: 0
      Description: >
        A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light
        armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).
    Fast Movement:
      Level: 1
      Short: Fast Movement
      Description:
        A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10
        feet.  This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light
        armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load.  Apply this
        bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load
        carried or armor worn.
    Illiteracy:
      Level: 1
      Short: Illiteracy
      Description:
        Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how
        to read and write.  A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the
        ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak.
        
        A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains
        literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the
        literacy he or she already had.
    Rage (Ex):
      Level: 1
      Short: Rage (1/day)
      Description:
        A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. 
        In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a
        +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but
        he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class.  The increase in Constitution
        increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but
        these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his
        Constitution score drops back to normal.  (These extra hit points
        are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging,
        a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or
        Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist,
        Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities
        that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or
        activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger
        (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to
        function.  He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item
        creation feats, and metamagic feats.  A fit of rage lasts for a
        number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved)
        Constitution modifier.  A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. 
        At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and
        restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2
        penalty to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the
        current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which
        point this limitation no longer applies; see below).
        
        A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st
        level he can use his rage ability once per day.  At 4th level and
        every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per
        day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level).  Entering a
        rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his
        action, not in response to someone else's action.
    Rage 4:
      Level: 4
      Short: Rage (2/day)
    Rage 8:
      Level: 8
      Short: Rage (3/day)
    Rage 12:
      Level: 12
      Short: Rage (4/day)
    Rage 16:
      Level: 16
      Short: Rage (5/day)
    Rage 20:
      Level: 20
      Short: Rage (6/day)
    Uncanny Dodge (Ex):
      Level: 2
      Short: Uncanny Dodge
      Description:
        At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any)
        even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. 
        However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

        If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he
        automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
    Trap Sense (Ex):
      Level: 3
      Short: Trap Sense +1
      Description:
        Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves
        made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made
        by traps.  These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels
        thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level).  Trap sense
        bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
    Trap Sense 6:
      Level: 6
      Short: Trap Sense +2
    Trap Sense 9:
      Level: 9
      Short: Trap Sense +3
    Trap Sense 12:
      Level: 12
      Short: Trap Sense +4
    Trap Sense 15:
      Level: 15
      Short: Trap Sense +5
    Trap Sense 18:
      Level: 18
      Short: Trap Sense +6
    Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):
      Level: 5
      Short: Improved Uncanny Dodge
      Description:
         At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. 
         This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the
         barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four
         more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.  If a
         character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second
         class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge
         instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge
         stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the
         character.
    Damage Reduction (Ex):
      Level: 7
      Short: Damage Reduction 1/-
      Description:
        At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction.

        Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt
        damage from a weapon or a natural attack.  At 10th level, and every
        three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this
        damage reduction rises by 1 point.  Damage reduction can reduce
        damage to 0 but not below 0.
    Damage Reduction 10:
      Level: 10
      Short: Damage Reduction 2/-
    Damage Reduction 13:
      Level: 13
      Short: Damage Reduction 3/-
    Damage Reduction 16:
      Level: 16
      Short: Damage Reduction 4/-
    Damage Reduction 19:
      Level: 19
      Short: Damage Reduction 5/-
    Greater Rage (Ex):
      Level: 11
      Short: Greater Rage
      Description:
        At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution
        during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will
        saves increases to +3.  The penalty to AC remains at -2.
    Indomitable Will (Ex):
      Level: 14
      Short: Indomitable Will
      Description:
        While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4
        bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells.  This bonus stacks
        with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves
        he also receives during his rage.
    Tireless Rage (Ex):
      Level: 17
      Short: Tireless Rage
      Description:
        At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at
        the end of his rage.
    Mighty Rage (Ex):
      Level: 20
      Short: Mighty Rage
      Description:
        At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution
        during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will
        saves increases to +4.  The penalty to AC remains at -2.
  Ex:
    Name: Ex-Barbarians
    Description:
      A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot
      gain more levels as a barbarian.  He retains all the other benefits of
      the class (damage reduction, fast movement, trap sense, and uncanny
      dodge).
