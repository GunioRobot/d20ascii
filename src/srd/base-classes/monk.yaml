  Class Features:
    Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
      Level: 0
      Description: >
        Monks are proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger,
        handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken,
        siangham, and sling.

        Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields
    
        When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy
        load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and
        flurry of blows abilities.

    AC Bonus:
      Level: 0
      Description: >
        When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if
        any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th
        level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels
        thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).
        
        These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the
        monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized
        or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or
        when she carries a medium or heavy load.
        
    Flurry of Blows:
      Level: 1
      Short: Flurry of Blows
      Description: >
        When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the
        expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in
        a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2
        penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting
        modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack
        Bonus column on Table: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round,
        so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before
        her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens
        to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full attack
        action to strike with a flurry of blows.
        
        When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed
        strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff,
        sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes
        and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using
        weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength
        bonus (not Str bonus x 1 1/2 or x 1/2) to her damage rolls for all
        successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both
        hands. The monk can't use any weapon other than a special monk
        weapon as part of a flurry of blows.
        
        In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate
        weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even
        though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still
        intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that
        she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so.
        
    Greater Flurry:
      Level: 11
      Short: Greater Flurry   
      Description:
        When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability
        improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets
        from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full
        base attack bonus.

    Unarmed Strike:
      Short: Unarmed Strike
      Level: 1
      Description: >
        At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.
        A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even
        from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make
        unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an
        off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply
        her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.
        
        Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can
        choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her
        attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal
        damage while grappling.
        
        A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and
        a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance
        or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.
        
        A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal
        person would, as shown on Table: The Monk. The unarmed damage on
        Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage
        than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large
        monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed
        Damage.
        
    Bonus Feat:
      Level: 1
      Short: Bonus Feat
      Description: >
        At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning
        Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either Combat
        Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may
        select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A
        monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for
        these feats to select them.

    Bonus Feat 2:
      Level: 2
      Short: Bonus Feat

    Bonus Feat 6:
      Level: 6
      Short: Bonus Feat
        
    Evasion (Ex):
      Short: Evasion
      Level: 2
      Description: >
        At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving
        throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a
        successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used
        only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk
        does not gain the benefit of evasion.
        
    Fast Movement (Ex):
      Short: Fast Movement
      Level: 3
      Description: >
        At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as
        shown on Table: The Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or
        heavy load loses this extra speed.
        
    Still Mind (Ex):
      Short: Still Mind
      Level: 3
      Description: >
        A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws
        against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.
        
    Ki Strike (Su):
      Short: Ki Strike (magic)
      Level: 4
      Description:
        At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her
        unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of
        dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. Ki strike
        improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed
        attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of
        dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level,
        her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the
        purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and
        bypassing hardness.
        
    Ki Strike 10:
      Short: Ki Strike (lawful)
      Level: 10

    Ki Strike 16:
      Short: Ki Strike (adamantine)
      Level: 16

    Slow Fall (Ex):
      Level: 4
      Short: Slow Fall 20 ft.
      Description: >
        At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use
        it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes
        damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The
        monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective
        distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk
        level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her
        descent and fall any distance without harm.
        
    Slow Fall 30:
      Level: 6
      Short: Slow Fall 30 ft.

    Slow Fall 40:
      Level: 8
      Short: Slow Fall 40 ft.

    Slow Fall 50:
      Level: 10
      Short: Slow Fall 50 ft.

    Slow Fall 60:
      Level: 12
      Short: Slow Fall 60 ft.

    Slow Fall 70:
      Level: 14
      Short: Slow Fall 70 ft.

    Slow Fall 80:
      Level: 16
      Short: Slow Fall 80 ft.

    Slow Fall 90:
      Level: 18
      Short: Slow Fall 90 ft.

    Slow Fall 100:
      Level: 20
      Short: Slow Fall any distance

    Purity of Body (Ex):
      Level: 5
      Short: Purity of Body
      Description:
        At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases except for
        supernatural and magical diseases.
        
    Wholeness of Body (Su):
      Level: 7
      Short: Wholeness of Body
      Description: >
        At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal
        a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk
        level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several
        uses.
        
    Improved Evasion (Ex):
      Short: Improved Evasion
      Level: 9
      Description: >
        At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no
        damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but
        henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless
        monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
        
    Diamond Body (Su):
      Level: 11
      Short: Diamond Body
      Description: >
        At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.
        
    Abundant Step (Su):
      Short: Abundant Step
      Level: 12
      Description: >
        At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces,
        as if using the spell dimension door, once per day. Her caster level
        for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).
        
    Diamond Soul (Ex):
      Level: 13
      Short: Diamond Soul
      Description: >
        At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current
        monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a
        spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster
        level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.
        
    Quivering Palm (Su):
      Level: 15
      Short: Quivering Palm
      Description: >
        Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body
        of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so
        desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she
        must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs,
        oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune
        to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes
        successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the
        quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay
        the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within
        a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt,
        the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless
        the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's
        level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is
        successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular
        quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one
        at a later time.
        
    Timeless Body (Ex):
      Level: 17
      Short: Timeless Body
      Description: >
        Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her
        ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such
        penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place.
        Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her
        time is up.
        
    Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex):
      Level: 17
      Short: Tongue of the Sun and Moon
      Description: >
        A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.
        
    Empty Body (Su):
      Level: 19
      Short: Empty Body
      Description: >
        At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state
        for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell
        etherealness. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions
        during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent
        in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.
        
    Perfect Self:
      Level: 20
      Short: Perfect Self
      Description: >
        At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore
        treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the
        monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical
        effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic,
        which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any
        attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by
        a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction. Unlike other
        outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if
        she were a member of her previous creature type.

    Name: Ex-Monks
    Description:
      A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but
      retains all monk abilities.
        
      Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass
      character, but multiclass monks face a special restriction.  A monk
      who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class
      by a level may never again raise her monk level, though she retains
      all her monk abilities.
