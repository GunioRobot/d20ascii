    Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with
        light armor and shields (except tower shields).

    Favored Enemy (Ex):
      Level: 1
      Short: 1st favored enemy
      Description: |
        At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table\: Ranger Favored Enemies.  The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type.  Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.
        
        At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table.  In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.
        
        If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

    Track:

      Short: Track
      Description:
        A ranger gains Track as a bonus feat.

    Wild Empathy (Ex):
      Level: 1
      Short: Wild Empathy
      Description:
        A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability
        functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a
        person.  The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his
        Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.  The
        typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent,
        while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

        To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study
        each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one
        another under normal visibility conditions.  Generally, influencing
        an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing
        people, it might take more or less time.

        The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast
        with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on
        the check.

    Combat Style (Ex):
      Level: 2
      Short: Combat Style
      Description: >
        At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to
        pursue: archery or two-weapon combat.  This choice affects the
        character's class features but does not restrict his selection of
        feats or special abilities in any way.

        If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid
        Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for
        that feat.

        If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the
        Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal
        prerequisites for that feat.

        The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears
        light or no armor.  He loses all benefits of his combat style when
        wearing medium or heavy armor.

    Endurance:
      Level: 3
      Short: Endurance
      Description:
        A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.

    Animal Companion (Ex):
      Level: 4
      Short: Animal Companion
      Description: >
        At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the
        following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle,
        hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium
        viper), or wolf.  If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an
        aquatic environment, the following creatures may be added to the
        ranger's list of options: manta ray, porpoise, Medium shark, and
        squid.  This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger
        on his adventures as appropriate for its kind.

        This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name,
        except that the ranger's effective druid level is one-half his
        ranger level.  A ranger may select from the alternative lists of
        animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective
        druid level is half his ranger level.  Like a druid, a ranger cannot
        select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his
        effective druid level below 1st.

    Spells:
      Level: 4
      Description: >
        Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small
        number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list.
        A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).

        To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal
        to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty Class for a saving
        throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the
        ranger's Wisdom modifier.

        Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of
        spells of each spell level per day.  His base daily spell allotment
        is given on Table: The Ranger.  In addition, he receives bonus
        spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score.  When Table: The
        Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given
        spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to
        based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.  The ranger does not
        have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric
        does.

        A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he
        cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place.  A
        ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list,
        provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose
        which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.

        Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and
        higher, his caster level is one-half his ranger level.

    Improved Combat Style (Ex):
      Short: Improved Combat Style
      Level: 6
      Description:
        At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style
        (archery or two-weapon combat) improves.  If he selected archery at
        2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he
        does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

        If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated
        as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not
        have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

        As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when
        he wears light or no armor.  He loses all benefits of his combat
        style when wearing medium or heavy armor.

    Woodland Stride (Ex):
      Level: 7
      Short: Woodland Stride
      Description:
        Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of
        undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and
        similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or
        suffering any other impairment.

        However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or
        magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.

    Swift Tracker (Ex):
      Level: 8
      Short: Swift Tracker
      Description:
        Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while
        following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty.  He takes
        only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to
        twice normal speed while tracking.

    Evasion (Ex):
      Level: 9
      Short: Evasion
      Description:
        At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks
        with great agility.  If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw
        against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful
        save, he instead takes no damage.  Evasion can be used only if the
        ranger is wearing light armor or no armor.  A helpless ranger does
        not gain the benefit of evasion.

    Combat Style Mastery (Ex):
      Level: 11
      Short: Combat Style Mastery
      Description:
        At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style
        (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again.  If he selected
        archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Precise
        Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for
        that feat.

        If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated
        as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not
        have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

        As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when
        he wears light or no armor.  He loses all benefits of his combat
        style when wearing medium or heavy armor.

    Camouflage (Ex):
      Level: 13
      Short: Camouflage
      Description:
        A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort
        of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or
        concealment.

    Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):
      Short: Hide in Plain Sight
      Level: 17
      Description:
        While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or
        higher can use the Hide skill even while being observed.
