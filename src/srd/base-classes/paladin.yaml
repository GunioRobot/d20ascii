  Class Features:
    Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
      Level: 0
      Short: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
      Description:
        Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with
        all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields
        (except tower shields).

    Aura of Good (Ex):
      Level: 1
      Short: Aura of Good
      Description:
        The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the detect good spell) is
        equal to her paladin level.

    Detect Evil (Sp):
      Level: 1
      Short: Detect Evil
      Description:
        At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.

    Smite Evil (Su):
      Level: 1
      Short: Smite Evil 1/day
      Description: >
        Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal
        melee attack.  She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack
        roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level.  If the
        paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite
        has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.

        At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may
        smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: The
        Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.

    Smite Evil 5:
      Level: 5
      Short: Smite Evil 2/day

    Smite Evil 10:
      Level: 10
      Short: Smite Evil 3/day

    Smite Evil 15:
      Level: 10
      Short: Smite Evil 4/day

    Smite Evil 20:
      Level: 10
      Short: Smite Evil 5/day

    Divine Grace (Su):
      Level: 2
      Short: Divine Grace
      Description:
        At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus
        (if any) on all saving throws.

    Lay on Hands (Su):
      Level: 2
      Short: Lay on Hands
      Description:
        Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or
        higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch.  Each
        day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her
        paladin level * her Charisma bonus.  A paladin may choose to divide
        her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to use
        it all at once.  Using lay on hands is a standard action.

        Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to
        deal damage to undead creatures.  Using lay on hands in this way
        requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an
        attack of opportunity.  The paladin decides how many of her daily
        allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an
        undead creature.

    Aura of Courage (Su):
      Level: 3
      Short: Aura of Courage
      Description:
        Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or
        otherwise).  Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus
        on saving throws against fear effects.

        This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if
        she is unconscious or dead.

    Divine Health (Ex):
      Level: 3
      Short: Divine Health
      Description:
        At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including
        supernatural and magical diseases.

    Turn Undead (Su):
      Level: 4
      Short: Turn Undead
      Description:
        When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability
        to turn undead.  She may use this ability a number of times per day
        equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.  She turns undead as a cleric of
        three levels lower would.

    Spells:
      Level: 4
      Description: >
        Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small
        number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell
        list.  A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance.

        To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal
        to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty Class for a saving
        throw against a paladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the
        paladin's Wisdom modifier.

        Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of
        spells of each spell level per day.  Her base daily spell allotment
        is given on Table: The Paladin.  In addition, she receives bonus
        spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score.  When Table: The
        Paladin indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given
        spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled
        to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level The paladin does
        not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric
        does.

        A paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though
        she cannot lose a prepared spell to spontaneously cast a cure spell
        in its place.  A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the
        paladin spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level,
        but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily
        meditation.

        Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and
        higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.

    Special Mount (Sp):
      Level: 5
      Short: Special Mount
      Description:
        Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the service of an unusually
        intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade
        against evil.  This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium
        paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin).

        Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call
        her mount from the celestial realms in which it resides.  This
        ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third
        the paladin's level.  The mount immediately appears adjacent to the
        paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may be
        dismissed at any time as a free action.  The mount is the same
        creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a
        particular mount from service.

        Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless
        of any damage it may have taken previously.  The mount also appears
        wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed.
        Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect.

        Should the paladin's mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving
        behind any equipment it was carrying.  The paladin may not summon
        another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level,
        whichever comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from
        the dead.  During this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a -1
        penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

    Remove Disease (Sp):
      Level: 6
      Short: Remove Disease 1/week
      Description:
        At 6th level, a paladin can produce a remove disease effect, as the
        spell, once per week.  She can use this ability one additional time
        per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th,
        three times at 12th, and so forth).

    Remove Disease 9:
      Level: 9
      Short: Remove Disease 2/week

    Remove Disease 12:
      Level: 12
      Short: Remove Disease 3/week

    Remove Disease 15:
      Level: 15
      Short: Remove Disease 4/week

    Remove Disease 18:
      Level: 18
      Short: Remove Disease 5/week

    Code of Conduct:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class
        abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act.

        Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect legitimate
        authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using
        poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use
        the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or
        threaten innocents.

    Associates:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral
        alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil
        characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who
        consistently offends her moral code.  A paladin may accept only
        henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.

  Ex:
    Name: Ex-Paladins
    Description:
      A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an evil
      act, or who grossly violates the code of conduct loses all paladin
      spells and abilities (including the service of the paladin's mount,
      but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies).  She may not
      progress any farther in levels as a paladin.  She regains her
      abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations
      (see the atonement spell description), as appropriate.

      Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a multiclass
      character, but multiclass paladins face a special restriction.  A
      paladin who gains a level in any class other than paladin may never
      again raise her paladin level, though she retains all her paladin
      abilities.

    Paladin Variants Freedom, Slaughter, And Tyranny: |
      Paladin Variants: Freedom, Slaughter, And Tyranny
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      _Source: Unearthed Arcana_
      
      The three paladin variants presented here demonstrate examples of alternative-alignment paladins. Each one follows a specific code of conduct tailored to its specific alignment. The paladin of freedom is chaotic good, dedicated to liberty and free thought. The paladin of tyranny is the opposite, a lawful evil villain bent on dominating those weaker than she. The paladin of slaughter is a brutal champion of chaos and evil who leaves only destruction trailing in his wake. (If you use these versions of the paladin class, you might consider designating the standard paladin as the "paladin of honor" to differentiate it from the variants.)
      
      These paladin variants aren't meant to be unique classes in and of themselves, but rather alignment-based variations of the paladin. They have the same Hit Die, skill points per level, weapon and armor proficiencies, and spells per day as the standard paladin. Their class skill lists are nearly identical, with exceptions noted below. Their spellcasting functions identically to that of the standard paladin (though their spell lists are somewhat different). When a class feature has the same name as a paladin class feature, it functions the same as the one described for the standard paladin.

      Replace Diplomacy with Bluff on the class skill list.
      
      Aura of Resolve (Su)
      ++++++++++++++++++++
      Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin of freedom is immune to compulsion effects. Each ally within 10 feet of him gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability otherwise functions identically to the paladin's aura of courage class feature.
      
      Spellcasting
      ++++++++++++

      Code of Conduct
      +++++++++++++++
      A paladin of freedom must be of chaotic good alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin of freedom's code requires that he respect individual liberty, help those in need (provided they do not use the help for lawful or evil ends), and punish those who threaten or curtail personal liberty.
      
      Associates
      ++++++++++
      While he may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin of freedom will never knowingly associate with evil characters (except on some sort of undercover mission), nor will he continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code. A paladin of freedom may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic good.
      
      Paladin of Slaughter Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The paladin of slaughter has all the standard paladin class features, except as noted below.
      
      Class Skills
      ++++++++++++
      Replace Diplomacy with Intimidate on the class skill list.
      
      Aura of Evil (Ex)
      +++++++++++++++++
      The power of a paladin of slaughter's aura of evil (see the detect evil spell) is equal to her paladin of slaughter level, just as with the aura of a cleric of an evil deity.
      
      Detect Good (Sp)
      ++++++++++++++++
      At will, a paladin of slaughter can use detect good, as the spell.
      
      Smite Good (Su)
      +++++++++++++++
      Once per day, a paladin of slaughter may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. This ability is otherwise identical to the standard paladin's ability to smite evil, including increased daily uses as the paladin of slaughter gains class levels.
      
      Deadly Touch (Su)
      +++++++++++++++++
      Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin of slaughter can cause wounds with a successful touch attack. Each day she can deal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. An opponent subjected to this attack can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin level + paladin's Cha modifier) to halve the damage dealt.
      
      Alternatively, a paladin of slaughter can use any or all of this power to cure damage to undead creatures, just as an inflict wounds spell does. This power otherwise functions identically to the paladin's lay on hands ability.
      
      Debilitating Aura (Su)
      ++++++++++++++++++++++
      Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin of slaughter radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of her to take a -1 penalty to Armor Class. This ability otherwise functions identically to the paladin's aura of courage class feature.
      
      Rebuke Undead (Su)
      ++++++++++++++++++
      A paladin of slaughter rebukes undead rather than turning undead.
      
      Cause Disease (Sp)
      ++++++++++++++++++
      A paladin of slaughter can inflict disease with her touch (as the contagion spell) a number of times per week that a standard paladin of her level would normally be able to remove disease.
      
      Spellcasting
      ++++++++++++
      Replace the standard paladin's spell list with the following spell list: 1st-bane, cause fear, corrupt weapon, create water, curse water, detect poison, detect undead, divine favor, endure elements, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, protection from good, protection from law, read magic, resistance, virtue; 2nd-bull's strength, cure light wounds, darkness, delay poison, eagle's splendor, inflict moderate wounds, owl's wisdom, resist energy, undetectable alignment; 3rd-blindness/deafness, cure moderate wounds, deeper darkness, dispel magic, greater magic weapon, heal mount, prayer, inflict serious wounds, magic circle against good/law; 4th-break enchantment, cure serious wounds, dispel good, dispel law, inflict critical wounds, poison, unholy sword.
      
      Code of Conduct
      +++++++++++++++
      A paladin of slaughter must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits a good act. Additionally, a paladin of slaughter's code requires that she disrespect all authority figures who have not proven their physical superiority to her, refuse help to those in need, and sow destruction and death at all opportunities.
      
      Associates
      ++++++++++
      While she may adventure with characters of any evil or neutral alignment, a paladin of slaughter will never knowingly associate with good characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin of tyranny may accept only henchmen, followers, and cohorts who are chaotic evil.
      
      Paladin of Tyranny Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The paladin of tyranny has all the standard paladin class features, except as noted below.
      
      Aura of Evil (Ex)
      +++++++++++++++++
      The power of a paladin of tyranny's aura of evil (see the detect evil spell) is equal to his paladin of tyranny level, just as with the aura of a cleric of an evil deity.
      
      Detect Good (Sp)
      ++++++++++++++++
      At will, a paladin of tyranny can use detect good, as the spell.
      
      Smite Good (Su)
      +++++++++++++++
      Once per day, a paladin of tyranny may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. This ability is otherwise identical to the standard paladin's ability to smite evil, including increased daily uses as the paladin of tyranny gains class levels.
      
      Deadly Touch (Su)
      +++++++++++++++++
      Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin of tyranny can cause wounds with a successful touch attack. Each day she can deal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. An opponent subjected to this attack can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin level + paladin's Cha modifier) to halve the damage dealt.
      
      Alternatively, a paladin of tyranny can use any or all of this power to cure damage to undead creatures, just as an inflict wounds spell does. This power otherwise functions identically to the paladin's lay on hands ability.
      
      Aura of Despair (Su)
      ++++++++++++++++++++
      Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin of tyranny radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This ability otherwise functions identically to the paladin's aura of courage class feature.
      
      Rebuke Undead (Su)
      ++++++++++++++++++
      A paladin of tyranny rebukes undead rather than turning undead.
      
      Cause Disease (Sp)
      ++++++++++++++++++
      A paladin of tyranny can inflict disease with his touch (as the contagion spell) a number of times per week that a standard paladin of her level would normally be able to remove disease.
      
      Spellcasting
      ++++++++++++
      Replace the paladin's spell list with the following spell list: 1st-bane, corrupt weapon, create water, curse water, detect poison, detect undead, divine favor, doom, endure elements, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, protection from chaos, protection from good, read magic, resistance, virtue; 2nd-bull's strength, cure light wounds, darkness, delay poison, eagle's splendor, hold person, inflict moderate wounds, owl's wisdom, resist energy, undetectable alignment; 3rd-bestow curse, cure moderate wounds, deeper darkness, discern lies, dispel magic, greater magic weapon, heal mount, prayer, inflict serious wounds, magic circle against chaos/good; 4th-break enchantment, cure serious wounds, dispel chaos, dispel good, dominate person, inflict critical wounds, unholy sword.
      
      Code of conduct
      +++++++++++++++
      A paladin of tyranny must be of lawful evil alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits a good act. Additionally, a paladin of tyranny's code requires that he respect authority figures as long as they have the strength to rule over the weak, act with discipline (not engaging in random slaughter, keeping firm control over those beneath his station, and so forth), help only those who help him maintain or improve his status, and punish those who challenge authority (unless, of course, such challengers prove more worthy to hold that authority).
      
      Associates
      ++++++++++
      While he may adventure with characters of any evil or neutral alignment, a paladin of tyranny will never knowingly associate with good characters unless it serves his needs, nor will he continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code. A paladin of tyranny may accept henchmen and followers of any alignment, but may only accept cohorts who are lawful evil.
