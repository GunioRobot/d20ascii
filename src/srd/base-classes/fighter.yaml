    Bonus Feats:
      Level: 1
      Short: Bonus Feat
      Description: >
        At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in
        addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus
        feat granted to a human character.  The fighter gains an additional
        bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter
        (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th).  These
        bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus
        feats.  A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus
        feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums.

        These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of
        any class gets from advancing levels.  A fighter is not limited to
        the list of fighter bonus feats when choosing these feats.
