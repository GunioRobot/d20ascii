      Short: Bonus Feat
      Description: >
        At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in
        addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus
        feat granted to a human character.  The fighter gains an additional
        bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter
        (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th).  These
        bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus
        feats.  A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus
        feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums.

        These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of
        any class gets from advancing levels.  A fighter is not limited to
        the list of fighter bonus feats when choosing these feats.

  Variants:
    Thug: |
      Fighter Variant: Thug
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      _Source: Unearthed Arcana_

      The thug is a street fighter, a survivor who learns to mix brute force
      with a bit of craftiness.  He has most of the fighter's strengths,
      along with some additional skills to help keep him alive on the mean
      streets.  Despite the name, not all thugs are mere hooligans-many are
      crafty veterans who use their knowledge of the streets to gain an
      advantage against their opponents.
      
      Most thugs are nonlawful, though sometimes gangs of thugs with a
      lawful streak band together.
      
      *Class Skills:*
      Add the following skills to the fighter's class skill list: Bluff,
      Gather Information, Knowledge (local), and Sleight of Hand.  The thug
      gains skill points per level equal to 4 + Int modifier (and has this
      number x4 at 1st level).
      
      Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The thug has all the standard fighter class features, except as noted
      below.
      
      *Weapon and Armor Proficiency:*
      Thugs are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with
      light armor.
      
      *Bonus Feats:*
      A thug doesn't gain the normal fighter bonus feat at 1st level. Also,
      add Urban Tracking to the list of fighter bonus feats available to the
      thug.
    
    Sneak Attack Fighter: |
      Fighter Variant: Sneak Attack Fighter
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      _Source: Unearthed Arcana_
      
      Some fighters prefer stealth and cunning over martial skill. This
      variant can also be combined with the thug variant.
      
      *Gain:*
      Sneak attack (as rogue).
      
      *Lose:*
      Bonus feats.
