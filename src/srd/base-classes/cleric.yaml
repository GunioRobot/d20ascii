  Class Features:

    Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of
        armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower
        shields).

        A cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat
        related to his deity's weapon as a bonus feat.  He also receives the
        appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the
        weapon falls into that category.

    Aura (Ex):
      Level: 0
      Description:
        A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a
        particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment
        (see the detect evil spell for details).  Clerics who don't worship
        a specific deity but choose the Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law domain
        have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.

    Spells:
      Level: 0
      Description: >
        A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell
        list.  However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain
        spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil,
        Good, and Lawful Spells, below.  A cleric must choose and prepare
        his spells in advance (see below).

        To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal
        to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty Class for a saving
        throw against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the
        cleric's Wisdom modifier.

        Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of
        spells of each spell level per day.  His base daily spell allotment
        is given on Table: The Cleric.  In addition, he receives bonus
        spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score.  A cleric also gets
        one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st
        level.  When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it
        must come from one of his two domains (see Deities, Domains, and
        Domain Spells, below).

        Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a
        time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation
        or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells.  Time spent
        resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells.  A
        cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list,
        provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose
        which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.

    Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        A cleric's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can
        perform, his values, and how others see him.  A cleric chooses two
        domains from among those belonging to his deity.  A cleric can
        select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his
        alignment matches that domain.

        If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects
        two domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities.
        The restriction on alignment domains still applies.

        Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell
        level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power.  The
        cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.

        With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric
        prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot.  If a
        domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare
        it only in his domain spell slot.

    Spontaneous Casting:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel
        stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not
        prepare ahead of time.  The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell
        that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the
        same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in
        its name).

        An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can't convert
        prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict
        spells (an inflict spell is one with "inflict" in its name).

        A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither
        good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict
        spells (player's choice).  Once the player makes this choice, it
        cannot be reversed.  This choice also determines whether the cleric
        turns or commands undead.

    Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his
        deity's (if he has one).  Spells associated with particular
        alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law
        descriptors in their spell descriptions.

    Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su):
      Level: 1
      Short: Turn or Rebuke Undead
      Description:
        Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead
        creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or
        unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).

        A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can
        turn or destroy undead creatures.  An evil cleric (or a neutral
        cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such
        creatures.  A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether
        his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil
        cleric.  Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed.  This
        decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous
        cure or inflict spells.

        A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal
        to 3 + his Charisma modifier.  A cleric with 5 or more ranks in
        Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against
        undead.

    Bonus Languages:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        A cleric's bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and
        Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil
        outsiders, respectively).  These choices are in addition to the
        bonus languages available to the character because of his race.

  Ex:
    Name: Ex-Clerics
    Description:
      A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god
      loses all spells and class features, except for armor and shield
      proficiencies and proficiency with simple weapons.  He cannot
      thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until he atones (see
      the atonement spell description).

  Variants:
    Cloistered Cleric: |
      Cleric Variant: Cloistered Cleric
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      _Source: Unearthed Arcana_
      
      The cloistered cleric spends more time than other clerics in study and
      prayer and less in martial training.  He gives up some of the cleric's
      combat prowess in exchange for greater skill access and a wider range
      of spells devoted to knowledge (and the protection of knowledge).
      
      Most cloistered clerics are nonchaotic, since they believe that a
      disciplined lifestyle lends itself better to learning.
      
      *Hit Die:*
      The cloistered cleric uses a d6 for his Hit Die (and has hit points at
      1st level equal to 6 + Con modifier).
      
      *Base Attack Bonus:*
      The cloistered cleric's lack of martial training means that he uses
      the poor base attack bonus.
      
      *Class Skills:*
      The cloistered cleric's class skill list includes Decipher Script,
      Speak Language, and all Knowledge skills (from the Knowledge domain,
      see below).  The cloistered cleric gains skill points per level equal
      to 6 + Int modifier (and has this number x4 at 1st level).
      
      Class Features
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The cloistered cleric has all the standard cleric class features,
      except as noted below.
      
      *Weapon and Armor Proficiency:*
      Cloistered clerics are proficient with simple weapons and with light
      armor.
      
      *Lore (Ex):*
      Thanks to long hours of study, a cloistered cleric has a wide range of
      stray knowledge.  This ability is identical to the bard's bardic
      knowledge class feature, using the cloistered cleric's class level in
      place of the bard level.
      
      *Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells:*
      Most cloistered clerics worship deities associated with knowledge and
      learning.
      
      In addition to any domains selected from his deity's list, a
      cloistered cleric automatically gains the Knowledge domain as a bonus
      domain (even if the Knowledge domain is not normally available to
      clerics of that deity).  He gains the Knowledge domain granted power
      and may select his bonus domain spell from the Knowledge domain or
      from one of his two regular domains.
      
      *Spellcasting:*
      Add the following spells to the cloistered cleric's class spell list:
      0-message; 1st-erase, identify, unseen servant; 2nd-fox's cunning;
      3rd-illusory script, secret page, tongues (reduced from 4th level);
      4th-detect scrying; 6th-analyze dweomer; 7th-sequester; 9th-vision.

    Smite Cleric: |
      Cleric Variant: Smite Cleric
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      _Source: Unearthed Arcana_
      
      Some clerics prefer to be champions of good (or evil), standing at the
      forefront of the battle against the enemy.
      
      *Gain:*
      Smite evil, if the cleric would normally channel positive energy, or
      smite good, if the cleric would normally channel negative energy (as
      paladin); aura of courage (as paladin).
      
      *Lose:*
      Turn undead.
