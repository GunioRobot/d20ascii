    Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
      Level: 0
      Description:
        Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand
        crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are
        proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

    Sneak Attack:
      Level: 1
      Short: Sneak Attack +1d6
      Description:
        If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself
        effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra
        damage.
        
        The rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be
        denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a
        Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This
        extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two
        rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with
        a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.
        
        Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is
        within 30 feet.
        
        With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a
        sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage.
        She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal
        damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.
        
        A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible
        anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal
        creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to
        critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be
        able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must
        be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while
        striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a
        creature whose vitals are beyond reach.
        
    Sneak Attack 3:
      Level: 3
      Short: Sneak Attack +2d6

    Sneak Attack 5:
      Level: 5
      Short: Sneak Attack +3d6

    Sneak Attack 7:

    Sneak Attack 19:
      Level: 19
      Short: Sneak Attack +10d6

    Trapfinding:
      Level: 1
      Short: Trapfinding
      Description:
        Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps
        when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20.
        
        Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it
        is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of
        the spell used to create it.
        
        Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm
        magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of
        the spell used to create it.
        
        A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device
        check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with
        her party) without disarming it.
        
    Evasion (Ex):
      Level: 2
      Short: Evasion
      Description:
        At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual
        attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving
        throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a
        successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used
        only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless
        rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.
        
    Trap Sense (Ex):
      Level: 3
      Short: Trap Sense +1
      Description:
        At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to
        danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to
        avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by
        traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to
        +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to
        +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.
        
        Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
        
    Trap Sense 6:
      Level: 6
      Short: Trap Sense +2
        
    Trap Sense 9:
      Level: 9
      Short: Trap Sense +3
        
    Trap Sense 12:
      Level: 12
      Short: Trap Sense +4
        
    Trap Sense 15:
      Level: 15
      Short: Trap Sense +5
        
    Trap Sense 18:
      Level: 18
      Short: Trap Sense +6
        
    Uncanny Dodge (Ex):
      Level: 4
      Short: Uncanny Dodge
      Description:
        Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses
        would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus
        to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an
        invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to
        AC if immobilized.
        
        If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she
        automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.
        
    Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):
      Level: 8
      Short: Improved Uncanny Dodge
      Description:
        A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.
        
        This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the
        character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four
        more rogue levels than the target does.
        
        If a character already has uncanny dodge from a second class, the
        character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and
        the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to
        determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
        
    Special Abilities:
      Short: Special Ability
      Level: 10
      Description:
        On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th,
        16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from
        among the following options.
        
        _Crippling Strike (Ex):_
        A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such
        precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged
        by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage.
        Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1
        point per day for each damaged ability.
        
        _Defensive Roll (Ex):_
        The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less
        damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she
        would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from
        a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue
        can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue
        must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save
        succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she
        takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react
        to it in order to execute her defensive roll-if she is denied her
        Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect
        would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half
        damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive
        roll.
        
        _Improved Evasion (Ex):_
        This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still
        takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks
        henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless
        rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
        
        _Opportunist (Ex):_
        Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against
        an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another
        character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity
        for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can't use
        the opportunist ability more than once per round.
        
        _Skill Mastery:_
        The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she
        can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.
        
        Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3
        + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of
        these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would
        normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special
        ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply
        to each time.
        
        _Slippery Mind (Ex):_
        This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from
        magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a
        rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or
        effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round
        later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed
        on her saving throw.
        
        _Feat:_
        A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.
