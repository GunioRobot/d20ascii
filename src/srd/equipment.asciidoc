EQUIPMENT
Assume a character owns at least one outfit of normal clothes. Pick any one of the following clothing outfits: artisan’s outfit, entertainer’s outfit, explorer’s outfit, monk’s outfit, peasant’s outfit, scholar’s outfit, or traveler’s outfit.

WEALTH AND MONEY
COINS
The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces. Each silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces (cp). In addition to copper, silver, and gold coins, there are also platinum pieces (pp), which are each worth 10 gp.
The standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce (fifty to the pound).

SELLING LOOT
In general, a character can sell something for half its listed price.
Trade goods are the exception to the half-price rule. A trade good, in this sense, is a valuable good that can be easily exchanged almost as if it were cash itself.

WEAPONS
WEAPON CATEGORIES
Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories.
These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon’s use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon’s usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium, or Large).
Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons: Anybody but a druid, monk, rogue, or wizard is proficient with all simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of mainly simple weapons and possibly also some martial or even exotic weapons. A character who uses a weapon with which he or she is not proficient takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls.
Melee and Ranged Weapons: Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.
Reach Weapons: Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, spiked chains, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren’t adjacent to him or her. Most reach double the wielder’s natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.
Double Weapons: Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaffs, and two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two weapons, but he or she incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.
The character can also choose to use a double weapon two handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
Thrown Weapons: Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his or her Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn’t designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn’t have a numeric entry in the Range Increment column on Table: Weapons), but a character who does so takes a –4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.
Projectile Weapons: Light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it’s a specially built composite shortbow, specially built composite longbow, or sling. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he or she uses a bow or a sling.
Ammunition: Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), or sling bullets (for slings). When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading. Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while normal ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons), and what happens to them after they are thrown.

Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons: This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon’s size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.
Light: A light weapon is easier to use in one’s off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and it can be used while grappling. A light weapon is used in one hand. Add the wielder’s Strength bonus (if any) to damage rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or one-half the wielder’s Strength bonus if it’s used in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the Strength bonus applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder’s primary hand only.
An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.
One-Handed: A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder’s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or 1/2 his or her Strength bonus if it’s used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls.
Two-Handed: Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.

Weapon Size: Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.
A weapon’s size category isn’t the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon’s size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.
Inappropriately Sized Weapons: A creature can’t make optimum use of a weapon that isn’t properly sized for it. A cumulative –2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn’t proficient with the weapon a –4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.
The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder’s size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. If a weapon’s designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can’t wield the weapon at all.

Improvised Weapons: Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses one in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

WEAPON QUALITIES
Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on Table: Weapons, below).
Cost: This value is the weapon’s cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon.
This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.
Damage: The Damage columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The column labeled “Dmg (S)” is for Small weapons. The column labeled “Dmg (M)” is for Medium weapons. If two damage ranges are given then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double weapon’s extra attack. Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage gives weapon damage values for weapons of those sizes.

Critical: The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical hits. When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.
Exception: Extra damage over and above a weapon’s normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.
x2: The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit.
x3: The weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit.
x3/x4: One head of this double weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit. The other head deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.
x4: The weapon deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.
19–20/x2: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. (The weapon has a threat range of 19–20.)
18–20/x2: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 18, 19, or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. (The weapon has a threat range of 18–20.)
Range Increment: Any attack at less than this distance is not penalized for range. However, each full range increment imposes a cumulative –2 penalty on the attack roll. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot out to ten range increments.
Weight: This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number for Small weapons and double it for Large weapons.
Type: Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.
Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two types, the damage it deals is not half one type and half another; all of it is both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.
In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation when the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.
Special: Some weapons have special features. See the weapon descriptions for details.

1 Weight figures are for Medium weapons. A Small weapon weighs half as much, and a Large weapon weighs twice as much.
2 When two types are given, the weapon is both types if the entry specifies “and,” or either type (player’s choice at time of attack) if the entry specifies “or.”
3 The weapon deals nonlethal damage rather than lethal damage.
4 Reach weapon.
5 Double weapon.

Weapons found on Table: Weapons that have special options for the wielder (“you”) are described below. Splash weapons are described under Special Substances and Items.
Arrows: An arrow used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier x2). Arrows come in a leather quiver that holds 20 arrows. An arrow that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
Axe, Orc Double: An orc double axe is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.
A creature wielding an orc double axe in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
Bolas: You can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can’t be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a set of bolas.
Bolts: A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (crit x2). Bolts come in a wooden case that holds 10 bolts (or 5, for a repeating crossbow). A bolt that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
Bullets, Sling: Bullets come in a leather pouch that holds 10 bullets. A bullet that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
Chain, Spiked: A spiked chain has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe.
You can make trip attacks with the chain. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the chain to avoid being tripped.
When using a spiked chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for you.
Crossbow, Hand: You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.
Crossbow, Heavy: You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a –4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.
Crossbow, Light: You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a –2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.
Crossbow, Repeating: The repeating crossbow (whether heavy or light) holds 5 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.
Dagger: You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a dagger on your body (see the Sleight of Hand skill).
Flail, Dire: A dire flail is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a dire flail in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon— only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
When using a dire flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the opposed attack roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the dire flail to avoid being tripped.
Flail or Heavy Flail: With a flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the flail to avoid being tripped.
Gauntlet: This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplate) come with gauntlets.
Gauntlet, Spiked: Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of spiked gauntlets. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. An attack with a spiked gauntlet is considered an armed attack.
Glaive: A glaive has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.
Guisarme: A guisarme has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.
You can also use it to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the guisarme to avoid being tripped.
Halberd: If you use a ready action to set a halberd against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
You can use a halberd to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the halberd to avoid being tripped.
Hammer, Gnome Hooked: A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. The hammer’s blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (crit x3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (crit x4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other head is the offhand weapon. A creature wielding a gnome hooked hammer in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
You can use a gnome hooked hammer to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the gnome hooked hammer to avoid being tripped.
Gnomes treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons.
Javelin: Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as nonproficient with it and take a –4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon.
Kama: The kama is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a kama special options.
You can use a kama to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the kama to avoid being tripped.
Lance: A lance deals double damage when used from the back of a charging mount. It has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.
While mounted, you can wield a lance with one hand.
Longbow: You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a longbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow (see below) but not a regular longbow.
Longbow, Composite: You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can’t effectively use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.
For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.
Longspear: A longspear has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe. If you use a ready action to set a longspear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
Net: A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net’s maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 15 Concentration check or be unable to cast the spell.
An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action).
A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.
A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.
Nunchaku: The nunchaku is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a nunchaku special options. With a nunchaku, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
Quarterstaff: A quarterstaff is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a quarterstaff in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
The quarterstaff is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a quarterstaff special options.
Ranseur: A ranseur has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.
With a ranseur, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
Rapier: You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a rapier sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for you. You can’t wield a rapier in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus to damage.
Sai: With a sai, you get a +4 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
The sai is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a sai special options.
Scythe: A scythe can be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the scythe to avoid being tripped.
Shield, Heavy or Light: You can bash with a shield instead of using it for defense. See Armor for details.
Shortbow: You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a shortbow while mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a shortbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow (see below) but not a regular shortbow.
Shortbow, Composite: You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite shortbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is lower than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can’t effectively use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost.
For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.
Shortspear: A shortspear is small enough to wield one-handed. It may also be thrown.
Shuriken: A shuriken is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding shuriken special options. A shuriken can’t be used as a melee weapon.
Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them and what happens to them after they are thrown.
Siangham: The siangham is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a siangham special options.
Sickle: A sickle can be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the sickle to avoid being tripped.
Sling: Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.
You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls.
Spear: A spear can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a spear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
Spiked Armor: You can outfit your armor with spikes, which can deal damage in a grapple or as a separate attack. See Armor for details.
Spiked Shield, Heavy or Light: You can bash with a spiked shield instead of using it for defense. See Armor for details.
Strike, Unarmed: A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at her option. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.
An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike.
Sword, Bastard: A bastard sword is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A character can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.
Sword, Two-Bladed: A two-bladed sword is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a two-bladed sword in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
Trident: This weapon can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a trident against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
Urgrosh, Dwarven: A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. The urgrosh’s axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other is the off-hand weapon. A creature wielding a dwarven urgrosh in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
If you use a ready action to set an urgrosh against a charge, you deal double damage if you score a hit against a charging character. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals damage.
Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.
Waraxe, Dwarven: A dwarven waraxe is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats a dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand.
Whip: A whip deals nonlethal damage. It deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don’t threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).
Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.
You can make trip attacks with a whip. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip to avoid being tripped.
When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if the attack fails).
You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for you.

MASTERWORK WEAPONS
A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
You can’t add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the Craft skill). The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).
Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.
All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality doesn’t stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon’s magic.
Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can’t create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and shields have lessened armor check penalties.

ARMOR

ARMOR QUALITIES
To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor Proficiency feats, but most classes are automatically proficient with the armors that work best for them.
Armor and shields can take damage from some types of attacks.
Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on Table: Armor and Shields, below).
Cost: The cost of the armor for Small or Medium humanoid creatures. See Armor for Unusual Creatures, below, for armor prices for other creatures.

Armor/Shield Bonus: Each armor grants an armor bonus to AC, while shields grant a shield bonus to AC. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn’t stack with other effects or items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn’t stack with other effects that grant a shield bonus.
Maximum Dex Bonus: This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC that this type of armor allows. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer’s ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn’t affect any other Dexterity-related abilities.
Even if a character’s Dexterity bonus to AC drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as losing a Dexterity bonus to AC.
Your character’s encumbrance (the amount of gear he or she carries) may also restrict the maximum Dexterity bonus that can be applied to his or her Armor Class.
Shields: Shields do not affect a character’s maximum Dexterity bonus.
Armor Check Penalty: Any armor heavier than leather hurts a character’s ability to use some skills. An armor check penalty number is the penalty that applies to Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble checks by a character wearing a certain kind of armor. Double the normal armor check penalty is applied to Swim checks. A character’s encumbrance (the amount of gear carried, including armor) may also apply an armor check penalty.
Shields: If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.
Nonproficient with Armor Worn: A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which he or she is not proficient takes the armor’s (and/or shield’s) armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all Strength-based and Dexterity-based ability and skill checks. The penalty for nonproficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for nonproficiency with shields.
Sleeping in Armor: A character who sleeps in medium or heavy armor is automatically fatigued the next day. He or she takes a –2 penalty on Strength and Dexterity and can’t charge or run. Sleeping in light armor does not cause fatigue.
Arcane Spell Failure: Armor interferes with the gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic component. Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they’re wearing armor. Bards can wear light armor without incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their bard spells.
Casting an Arcane Spell in Armor: A character who casts an arcane spell while wearing armor must usually make an arcane spell failure roll. The number in the Arcane Spell Failure Chance column on Table: Armor and Shields is the chance that the spell fails and is ruined. If the spell lacks a somatic component, however, it can be cast with no chance of arcane spell failure.
Shields: If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, add the two numbers together to get a single arcane spell failure chance.
Speed: Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. The number on Table: Armor and Shields is the character’s speed while wearing the armor. Humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs have an unencumbered speed of 30 feet.
They use the first column. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have an unencumbered speed of 20 feet. They use the second column. Remember, however, that a dwarf ’s land speed remains 20 feet even in medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.
Shields: Shields do not affect a character’s speed.
Weight: This column gives the weight of the armor sized for a Medium wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor for Large characters weighs twice as much.

ARMOR DESCRIPTIONS
Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on Table: Armor and Shields are described below.
Armor Spikes: You can have spikes added to your armor, which allow you to deal extra piercing damage (see Table: Weapons) on a successful grapple attack. The spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are not proficient with them, you take a –4 penalty on grapple checks when you try to use them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. (You can’t also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.)
An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes’ effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.
Banded Mail: The suit includes gauntlets.
Breastplate: It comes with a helmet and greaves.
Buckler: This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you don’t get the buckler’s AC bonus for the rest of the round.
You can’t bash someone with a buckler.
Chain Shirt: A chain shirt comes with a steel cap.
Chainmail: The suit includes gauntlets.
Full Plate: The suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4x100) gold pieces.
Gauntlet, Locked: This armored gauntlet has small chains and braces that allow the wearer to attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it cannot be dropped easily. It provides a +10 bonus on any roll made to keep from being disarmed in combat. Removing a weapon from a locked gauntlet or attaching a weapon to a locked gauntlet is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
The price given is for a single locked gauntlet. The weight given applies only if you’re wearing a breastplate, light armor, or no armor. Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as part of the armor.
While the gauntlet is locked, you can’t use the hand wearing it for casting spells or employing skills. (You can still cast spells with somatic components, provided that your other hand is free.)
Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike.
Half-Plate: The suit includes gauntlets.
Scale Mail: The suit includes gauntlets.
Shield, Heavy, Wooden or Steel: You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A heavy shield is so heavy that you can’t use your shield hand for anything else.
Wooden or Steel: Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.
Shield Bash Attacks: You can bash an opponent with a heavy shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table: Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a heavy shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a heavy shield as a one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.
Shield, Light, Wooden or Steel: You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A light shield’s weight lets you carry other items in that hand, although you cannot use weapons with it.
Wooden or Steel: Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.
Shield Bash Attacks: You can bash an opponent with a light shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table: Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a light shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a light shield as a light weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.
Shield, Tower: This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as you are. In most situations, it provides the indicated shield bonus to your AC. However, you can instead use it as total cover, though you must give up your attacks to do so. The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else.
When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a –2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield’s encumbrance.
Shield Spikes: When added to your shield, these spikes turn it into a martial piercing weapon that increases the damage dealt by a shield bash as if the shield were designed for a creature one size category larger than you. You can’t put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack (see above).
An enhancement bonus on a spiked shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but a spiked shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.
Splint Mail: The suit includes gauntlets.

MASTERWORK ARMOR
Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1.
A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of armor or shield.
The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon.
All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.
You can’t add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork item.

ARMOR FOR UNUSUAL CREATURES
Armor and shields for unusually big creatures, unusually little creatures, and nonhumanoid creatures have different costs and weights from those given on Table: Armor and Shields.

GETTING INTO AND OUT OF ARMOR
The time required to don armor depends on its type; see Table: Donning Armor.
Don: This column tells how long it takes a character to put the armor on. (One minute is 10 rounds.) Readying (strapping on) a shield is only a move action.
Don Hastily: This column tells how long it takes to put the armor on in a hurry. The armor check penalty and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 point worse than normal.
Remove: This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off. Loosing a shield (removing it from the arm and dropping it) is only a move action.

ADVENTURING GEAR
few of the pieces of adventuring gear found on Table: Goods and Services are described below, along with any special benefits they confer on the user (“you”).
Caltrops: A caltrop is a four-pronged iron spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.
Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature’s shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature’s speed is reduced by one-half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical curing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.
Caltrops may not be effective against unusual opponents.
Candle: A candle dimly illuminates a 5-foot radius and burns for 1 hour.
Chain: Chain has hardness 10 and 5 hit points. It can be burst with a DC 26 Strength check.
Crowbar: A crowbar it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made for such purposes. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.
Flint and Steel: Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a full-round action, and lighting any other fire with them takes at least that long.
Grappling Hook: Throwing a grappling hook successfully requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 per 10 feet of distance thrown).
Hammer: If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.
Ink: This is black ink. You can buy ink in other colors, but it costs twice as much.
Jug, Clay: This basic ceramic jug is fitted with a stopper and holds 1 gallon of liquid.
Lamp, Common: A lamp clearly illuminates a 15-foot radius, provides shadowy illumination out to a 30-foot radius, and burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.
Lantern, Bullseye: A bullseye lantern provides clear illumination in a 60-foot cone and shadowy illumination in a 120-foot cone. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a bullseye lantern in one hand.
Lantern, Hooded: A hooded lantern clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a hooded lantern in one hand.
Lock: The DC to open a lock with the Open Lock skill depends on the lock’s quality: simple (DC 20), average (DC 25), good (DC 30), or superior (DC 40).
Manacles and Manacles, Masterwork: Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.
Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.
For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature.
For a Large creature, manacles cost ten times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, one hundred times this amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles.
Oil: A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern. You can use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist’s fire, except that it takes a full round action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.
You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.
Ram, Portable: This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to break open a door and it allows a second person to help you without having to roll, increasing your bonus by 2.
Rope, Hempen: This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 23 Strength check.
Rope, Silk: This rope has 4 hit points and can be burst with a DC 24 Strength check. It is so supple that it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope checks.
Spyglass: Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.
Torch: A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly illuminating a 20-foot radius and providing shadowy illumination out to a 40- foot radius. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage.
Vial: A vial holds 1 ounce of liquid. The stoppered container usually is no more than 1 inch wide and 3 inches high.

SPECIAL SUBSTANCES AND ITEMS
Any of these substances except for the everburning torch and holy water can be made by a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill.
Acid: You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.
Alchemist’s Fire: You can throw a flask of alchemist’s fire as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.
A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.
Antitoxin: If you drink antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison for 1 hour.
Everburning Torch: This otherwise normal torch has a continual flame spell cast upon it. An everburning torch clearly illuminates a 20-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to a 40-foot radius.
Holy Water: Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.
Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.
Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit).
Smokestick: This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a 10- foot cube (treat the effect as a fog cloud spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally.
Sunrod: This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. It clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.
Tanglefoot Bag: When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.
A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of universal solvent to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.
Thunderstone: You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a –4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast.
Since you don’t need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target square as AC 5.
Tindertwig: The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round action), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.

TOOLS AND SKILL KITS
Alchemist’s Lab: An alchemist’s lab always has the perfect tool for making alchemical items, so it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks. It has no bearing on the costs related to the Craft (alchemy) skill. Without this lab, a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill is assumed to have enough tools to use the skill but not enough to get the +2 bonus that the lab provides.
Artisan’s Tools: These special tools include the items needed to pursue any craft. Without them, you have to use improvised tools (–2 penalty on Craft checks), if you can do the job at all.
Artisan’s Tools, Masterwork: These tools serve the same purpose as artisan’s tools (above), but masterwork artisan’s tools are the perfect tools for the job, so you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft checks made with them.
Climber’s Kit: This is the perfect tool for climbing and gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks.
Disguise Kit: The kit is the perfect tool for disguise and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. A disguise kit is exhausted after ten uses.
Healer’s Kit: It is the perfect tool for healing and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks. A healer’s kit is exhausted after ten uses.
Holy Symbol, Silver or Wooden: A holy symbol focuses positive energy. A cleric or paladin uses it as the focus for his spells and as a tool for turning undead. Each religion has its own holy symbol.
Unholy Symbols: An unholy symbol is like a holy symbol except that it focuses negative energy and is used by evil clerics (or by neutral clerics who want to cast evil spells or command undead).
Magnifying Glass: This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a full-round action. A magnifying glass grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks
involving any item that is small or highly detailed.
Musical Instrument, Common or Masterwork: A masterwork instrument grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks involving its use.
Scale, Merchant’s: A scale grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals.
Spell Component Pouch: A spellcaster with a spell component pouch is assumed to have all the material components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for those components that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that wouldn’t fit in a pouch.
Spellbook, Wizard’s (Blank): A spellbook has 100 pages of parchment, and each spell takes up one page per spell level (one page each for 0-level spells).
Thieves’ Tools: This kit contains the tools you need to use the Disable Device and Open Lock skills. Without these tools, you must improvise tools, and you take a –2 circumstance penalty on Disable Device and Open Locks checks.
Thieves’ Tools, Masterwork: This kit contains extra tools and tools of better make, which grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Disable Device and Open Lock checks.
Tool, Masterwork: This well-made item is the perfect tool for the job. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a related skill check (if any). Bonuses provided by multiple masterwork items used toward the same skill check do not stack.
Water Clock: This large, bulky contrivance gives the time accurate to within half an hour per day since it was last set. It requires a source of water, and it must be kept still because it marks time by the regulated flow of droplets of water.

CLOTHING
Artisan’s Outfit: This outfit includes a shirt with buttons, a skirt or pants with a drawstring, shoes, and perhaps a cap or hat. It may also include a belt or a leather or cloth apron for carrying tools.
Cleric’s Vestments: These ecclesiastical clothes are for performing priestly functions, not for adventuring.
Cold Weather Outfit: A cold weather outfit includes a wool coat, linen shirt, wool cap, heavy cloak, thick pants or skirt, and
boots. This outfit grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against exposure to cold weather.
Courtier’s Outfit: This outfit includes fancy, tailored clothes in whatever fashion happens to be the current style in the courts of the nobles. Anyone trying to influence nobles or courtiers while wearing street dress will have a hard time of it (–2 penalty on Charisma-based skill checks to influence such individuals). If you wear this outfit without jewelry (costing an additional 50 gp), you look like an out-of-place commoner.
Entertainer’s Outfit: This set of flashy, perhaps even gaudy, clothes is for entertaining. While the outfit looks whimsical, its practical design lets you tumble, dance, walk a tightrope, or just run (if the audience turns ugly).
Explorer’s Outfit: This is a full set of clothes for someone who never knows what to expect. It includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak. Rather than a leather skirt, a leather overtunic may be worn over a cloth skirt. The clothes have plenty of pockets (especially the cloak). The outfit also includes any extra items you might need, such as a scarf or a wide-brimmed hat.
Monk’s Outfit: This simple outfit includes sandals, loose breeches, and a loose shirt, and is all bound together with sashes. The outfit is designed to give you maximum mobility, and it’s made of high-quality fabric. You can hide small weapons in pockets hidden in the folds, and the sashes are strong enough to serve as short ropes.
Noble’s Outfit: This set of clothes is designed specifically to be expensive and to show it. Precious metals and gems are worked into the clothing. To fit into the noble crowd, every would-be noble also needs a signet ring (see Adventuring Gear, above) and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp).
Peasant’s Outfit: This set of clothes consists of a loose shirt and baggy breeches, or a loose shirt and skirt or overdress. Cloth wrappings are used for shoes.
Royal Outfit: This is just the clothing, not the royal scepter, crown, ring, and other accoutrements. Royal clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance.
Scholar’s Outfit: Perfect for a scholar, this outfit includes a robe, a belt, a cap, soft shoes, and possibly a cloak.
Traveler’s Outfit: This set of clothes consists of boots, a wool skirt or breeches, a sturdy belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), and an ample cloak with a hood.

FOOD, DRINK, AND LODGING
Inn: Poor accommodations at an inn amount to a place on the floor near the hearth. Common accommodations consist of a place on a raised, heated floor, the use of a blanket and a pillow. Good accommodations consist of a small, private room with one bed, some amenities, and a covered chamber pot in the corner.
Meals: Poor meals might be composed of bread, baked turnips, onions, and water. Common meals might consist of bread, chicken stew, carrots, and watered-down ale or wine. Good meals might be composed of bread and pastries, beef, peas, and ale or wine.

MOUNTS AND RELATED GEAR
Barding, Medium Creature and Large Creature: Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table: Armor and Shields.
Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much as the armor found on Table: Armor and Shields (see Armor for Unusual Creatures). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.


———— Base Speed —––——
Barding

Heavy
30 ft.1

40 ft.1
1 A mount wearing heavy armor moves at only triple its normal speed when running instead of quadruple.

Flying mounts can’t fly in medium or heavy barding.
Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on Table: Donning Armor. A barded animal cannot be used to carry any load other than the rider and normal saddlebags.
Dog, Riding: This Medium dog is specially trained to carry a Small humanoid rider. It is brave in combat like a warhorse. You take no damage when you fall from a riding dog.
Donkey or Mule: Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger, hardy, surefooted, and capable of carrying heavy loads over vast distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or a mule is willing (though not eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places.
Feed: Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze to sustain themselves, but providing feed for them is much better. If you have a riding dog, you have to feed it at least some meat.
Horse: A horse (other than a pony) is suitable as a mount for a human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, or half-orc. A pony is smaller than a horse and is a suitable mount for a gnome or halfling.
Warhorses and warponies can be ridden easily into combat. Light horses, ponies, and heavy horses are hard to control in combat.
Saddle, Exotic: An exotic saddle is like a normal saddle of the same sort except that it is designed for an unusual mount. Exotic saddles come in military, pack, and riding styles.
Saddle, Military: A military saddle braces the rider, providing a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle. If you’re knocked unconscious while in a military saddle, you have a 75% chance to stay in the saddle (compared to 50% for a riding saddle).
Saddle, Pack: A pack saddle holds gear and supplies, but not a rider. It holds as much gear as the mount can carry.
Saddle, Riding: The standard riding saddle supports a rider.

TRANSPORT
Carriage: This four-wheeled vehicle can transport as many as four people within an enclosed cab, plus two drivers. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A carriage comes with the harness needed to pull it.
Cart: This two-wheeled vehicle can be drawn by a single horse (or other beast of burden). It comes with a harness.
Galley: This three-masted ship has seventy oars on either side and requires a total crew of 200. A galley is 130 feet long and 20 feet wide, and it can carry 150 tons of cargo or 250 soldiers. For 8,000 gp more, it can be fitted with a ram and castles with firing platforms fore, aft, and amidships. This ship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It moves about 4 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.
Keelboat: This 50- to 75-foot-long ship is 15 to 20 feet wide and has a few oars to supplement its single mast with a square sail. It has a crew of eight to fifteen and can carry 40 to 50 tons of cargo or 100 soldiers. It can make sea voyages, as well as sail down rivers (thanks to its flat bottom). It moves about 1 mile per hour.
Longship: This 75-foot-long ship with forty oars requires a total crew of 50. It has a single mast and a square sail, and it can carry 50 tons of cargo or 120 soldiers. A longship can make sea voyages. It moves about 3 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.
Rowboat: This 8- to 12-foot-long boat holds two or three Medium passengers. It moves about 1-1/2 miles per hour.
Sailing Ship: This larger, seaworthy ship is 75 to 90 feet long and 20 feet wide and has a crew of 20. It can carry 150 tons of cargo. It has square sails on its two masts and can make sea voyages. It moves about 2 miles per hour.
Sled: This is a wagon on runners for moving through snow and over ice. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A sled comes with the harness needed to pull it.
Wagon: This is a four-wheeled, open vehicle for transporting heavy loads. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A wagon comes with the harness needed to pull it.
Warship: This 100-foot-long ship has a single mast, although oars can also propel it. It has a crew of 60 to 80 rowers. This ship can carry 160 soldiers, but not for long distances, since there isn’t room for supplies to support that many people. The warship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It is not used for cargo. It moves about 2-1/2 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.

SPELLCASTING AND SERVICES
Sometimes the best solution for a problem is to hire someone else to take care of it.
Coach Cab: The price given is for a ride in a coach that transports people (and light cargo) between towns. For a ride in a cab that transports passengers within a city, 1 copper piece usually takes you anywhere you need to go.
Hireling, Trained: The amount given is the typical daily wage for mercenary warriors, masons, craftsmen, scribes, teamsters, and other trained hirelings. This value represents a minimum wage; many such hirelings require significantly higher pay.
Hireling, Untrained: The amount shown is the typical daily wage for laborers, porters, cooks, maids, and other menial workers.
Messenger: This entry includes horse-riding messengers and runners. Those willing to carry a message to a place they were going anyway may ask for only half the indicated amount.
Road or Gate Toll: A toll is sometimes charged to cross a well-trodden, well-kept, and well-guarded road to pay for patrols on it and for its upkeep. Occasionally, a large walled city charges a toll to enter or exit (or sometimes just to enter).
Ship’s Passage: Most ships do not specialize in passengers, but many have the capability to take a few along when transporting cargo. Double the given cost for creatures larger than Medium or creatures that are otherwise difficult to bring aboard a ship.
Spell: The indicated amount is how much it costs to get a spellcaster to cast a spell for you. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at his or her convenience (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell in question). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell you need to negotiate with him or her, and the default answer is no.
The cost given is for a spell with no cost for a material component or focus component and no XP cost. If the spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell.
If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell. If the spell has an XP cost, add 5 gp per XP lost.
Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell, which isn’t certain). In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren’t returning with the caster.
In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn’t guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells.


MAGIC ITEMS I (BASICS & CREATION)

Magic items are divided into categories: armor, weapons, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, and wondrous items. In addition, some magic items are cursed or intelligent. Finally, a few magic items are of such rarity and power that they are considered to belong to a category of their own: artifacts. Artifacts are classified in turn as minor (extremely rare but not one-of-a-kind items) or major (each one unique and extremely potent).
Armor and Shields: Magic armor (including shields) offers improved, magical protection to the wearer. Some of these items confer abilities beyond a benefit to Armor Class.
Weapons: Magic weapons are created with a variety of combat powers and almost always improve the attack and damage rolls of the wielder as well.
Potions: A potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect that affects only the drinker.
Rings: A ring is a circular metal band worn on the finger (no more than two rings per wearer) that has a spell-like power (often a constant effect that affects the wearer).
Rods: A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike that of any known spell.
Scrolls: A scroll is a spell magically inscribed onto paper or parchment so that it can be used later.
Staffs: A staff has a number of different (but often related) spell effects. A newly created staff has 50 charges, and each use of the staff depletes one or more of those charges.
Wands: A wand is a short stick imbued with the power to cast a specific spell. A newly created wand has 50 charges, and each use of the wand depletes one of those charges.
Wondrous Items: These objects include magic jewelry, tools, books, clothing, and much more.

Magic Items and Detect Magic
When detect magic identifies a magic item’s school of magic, this information refers to the school of the spell placed within the potion, scroll, or wand, or the prerequisite given for the item. The description of each item provides its aura strength and the school it belongs to.
If more than one spell is given as a prerequisite, use the highest-level spell. If no spells are included in the prerequisites, use the following default guidelines.
Item Nature
School
Armor and protection items
Abjuration
Weapons or offensive items
Evocation
Bonus to ability score, on skill check, etc.
Transmutation

USING ITEMS
To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your finger. Some items, once donned, function constantly. In most cases, using an item requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, spell completion items are treated like spells in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.
Activating a magic item is a standard action unless the item description indicates otherwise. However, the casting time of a spell is the time required to activate the same power in an item, regardless of the type of magic item, unless the item description specifically states otherwise.
The four ways to activate magic items are described below.
Spell Completion: This is the activation method for scrolls. A scroll is a spell that is mostly finished. The preparation is done for the caster, so no preparation time is needed beforehand as with normal spellcasting. All that’s left to do is perform the finishing parts of the spellcasting (the final gestures, words, and so on). To use a spell completion item safely, a character must be of high enough level in the right class to cast the spell already. If he can’t already cast the spell, there’s a chance he’ll make a mistake. Activating a spell completion item is a standard action and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as casting a spell does.
Spell Trigger: Spell trigger activation is similar to spell completion, but it’s even simpler. No gestures or spell finishing is needed, just a special knowledge of spellcasting that an appropriate character would know, and a single word that must be spoken. Anyone with a spell on his or her spell list knows how to use a spell trigger item that stores that spell. (This is the case even for a character who can’t actually cast spells, such as a 3rd-level paladin.) The user must still determine what spell is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Command Word: If no activation method is suggested either in the magic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.
A command word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, the command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Activating a command word magic item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Sometimes the command word to activate an item is written right on the item. Occasionally, it might be hidden within a pattern or design engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item might bear a clue to the command word.
The Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) skills might be useful in helping to identify command words or deciphering clues regarding them. A successful check against DC 30 is needed to come up with the word itself. If that check is failed, succeeding on a second check (DC 25) might provide some insight into a clue.
The spells identify and analyze dweomer both reveal command words.
Use Activated: This type of item simply has to be used in order to activate it. A character has to drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, look through a lens, sprinkle dust, wear a ring, or don a hat. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.
Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Continually functioning items are practically always items that one wears. A few must simply be in the character’s possession (on his person). However, some items made for wearing must still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command word (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen. The description of an item states whether a command word is needed in such a case.
Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated magic item is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes an attack of opportunity in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a magical effect occurs, then use activation is a standard action. If the item’s activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time use activation is not an action at all.
Use activation doesn’t mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes automatically, such from drinking a potion or swinging a sword.

SIZE AND MAGIC ITEMS
When an article of magic clothing or jewelry is discovered, most of the time size shouldn’t be an issue. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they adjust themselves magically to the wearer. Size should not keep characters of various kinds from using magic items.
There may be rare exceptions, especially with racial specific items.
Armor and Weapon Sizes: Armor and weapons that are found at random have a 30% chance of being Small (01–30), a 60% chance of being Medium (31–90), and a 10% chance of being any other size (91–100).

MAGIC ITEMS ON THE BODY
Many magic items need to be donned by a character who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities. It’s possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as twelve magic items at the same time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.
A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following groups, keyed to which place on the body the item is worn.
• One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the head
• One pair of eye lenses or goggles on or over the eyes
• One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab around the neck
• One vest, vestment, or shirt on the torso
• One robe or suit of armor on the body (over a vest, vestment, or shirt)
• One belt around the waist (over a robe or suit of armor)
• One cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a robe or suit of armor)
• One pair of bracers or bracelets on the arms or wrists
• One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on the hands
• One ring on each hand (or two rings on one hand)
• One pair of boots or shoes on the feet
Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes. However, additional items beyond those listed above have no effect.
Some items can be worn or carried without taking up space on a character’s body. The description of an item indicates when an item has this property.

SAVING THROWS AGAINST MAGIC ITEM POWERS
Magic items produce spells or spell-like effects. For a saving throw against a spell or spell-like effect from a magic item, the DC is 10 + the level of the spell or effect + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to cast that level of spell.
Staffs are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw as if the wielder cast the spell, including caster level and all modifiers to save DC.
Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact spell equivalent (making its level otherwise difficult to determine quickly).

DAMAGING MAGIC ITEMS
A magic item doesn’t need to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his save. Magic items should always get a saving throw against spells that might deal damage to them— even against attacks from which a nonmagical item would normally get no chance to save. Magic items use the same saving throw bonus for all saves, no matter what the type (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will). A magic item’s saving throw bonus equals 2 + one-half its caster level (round down). The only exceptions to this are intelligent magic items, which make Will saves based on their own Wisdom scores.
Magic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical items of the same sort. A damaged magic item continues to function, but if it is destroyed, all its magical power is lost.

REPAIRING MAGIC ITEMS
Some magic items take damage over the course of an adventure. It costs no more to repair a magic item with the Craft skill than it does to repair its nonmagical counterpart. The make whole spell also repairs a damaged—but not completely broken—magic item.

INTELLIGENT ITEMS
Some magic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all their own. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to those with a single use or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.)
In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence.

CURSED ITEMS
Some items are cursed—incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces. Cursed items might be particularly dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor flaw, an inconvenient requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are cursed 5% of the time.

CHARGES, DOSES, AND MULTIPLE USES
Many items, particularly wands and staffs, are limited in power by the number of charges they hold. Normally, charged items have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges left (round down, minimum 1). If the item has a maximum number of charges other than 50, roll randomly to determine how many charges are left.
Prices listed are always for fully charged items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged.) For an item that’s worthless when its charges run out (which is the case for almost all charged items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its charges, only part of the item’s value is based on the number of charges left.

MAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS
Each general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.
General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other material. The AC, hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The AC assumes that the item is unattended and includes a –5 penalty for the item’s effective Dexterity of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the creature’s Dexterity modifier in place of the –5 penalty.
Some individual items, notably those that simply store spells and nothing else, don’t get full-blown descriptions. Reference the spell’s description for details, modified by the form of the item (potion, scroll, wand, and so on). Assume that the spell is cast at the minimum level required to cast it
Items with full descriptions have their powers detailed, and each of the following topics is covered in notational form at the end of the description.
• Aura: Most of the time, a detect magic spell will reveal the school of magic associated with a magic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item’s notational entry. See the detect magic spell description for details.
• Caster Level: The next item in a notational entry gives the caster level of the item, indicating its relative power. The caster level determines the item’s saving throw bonus, as well as range or other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable). It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a dispel magic spell or similar situation. This information is given in the form “CL x,” where “CL” is an abbreviation for caster level and “x” is an ordinal number representing the caster level itself.
For potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the caster level of an item at any number high enough to cast the stored spell and not higher than her own caster level. For other magic items, the caster level is determined by the item itself. In this case, the creator’s caster level must be as high as the item’s caster level (and prerequisites may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator’s level).
• Prerequisites: Certain requirements must be met in order for a character to create a magic item. These include feats, spells, and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and race or kind. The prerequisites for creation of an item are given immediately following the item’s caster level.
A spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has prepared the spell (or who knows the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard), or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger magic item or a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell effect. For each day that passes in the creation process, the creator must expend one spell completion item or one charge from a spell trigger item if either of those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.
It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.
If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator’s level must be known. The character designated as the creator pays the XP required to make the item.
Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one or more spells (or some other requirement in addition to the feat).
When two spells at the end of a list are separated by “or,” one of those spells is required in addition to every other spell mentioned prior to the last two.
• Market Price: This gold piece value, given following the word “Price,” represents the price someone should expect to pay to buy the item. The market price for an item that can be constructed with an item creation feat is usually equal to the base price plus the price for any components (material or XP).
• Cost to Create: The next part of a notational entry is the cost in gp and XP to create the item, given following the word
“Cost.” This information appears only for items with components (material or XP), which make their market prices higher than their base prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs of the components.
Items without components do not have a “Cost” entry. For them, the market price and the base price are the same. The cost in gp is 1/2 the market price, and the cost in XP is 1/25 the market price.
• Weight: The notational entry for many wondrous items ends with a value for the item’s weight. When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining how much of a load a character can carry).

CREATING MAGIC ITEMS
To create magic items, spellcasters use special feats. They invest time, money, and their own personal energy (in the form of experience points) in an item’s creation.
Note that all items have prerequisites in their descriptions. These prerequisites must be met for the item to be created. Most of the time, they take the form of spells that must be known by the item’s creator (although access through another magic item or spellcaster is allowed).
While item creation costs are handled in detail below, note that normally the two primary factors are the caster level of the creator and the level of the spell or spells put into the item. A creator can create an item at a lower caster level than her own, but never lower than the minimum level needed to cast the needed spell. Using metamagic feats, a caster can place spells in items at a higher level than normal.
Magic supplies for items are always half of the base price in gp and 1/25 of the base price in XP. For many items, the market price equals the base price.
Armor, shields, weapons, and items with a value independent of their magically enhanced properties add their item cost to the market price. The item cost does not influence the base price (which determines the cost of magic supplies and the experience point cost), but it does increase the final market price.
In addition, some items cast or replicate spells with costly material components or with XP components. For these items, the market price equals the base price plus an extra price for the spell component costs. Each XP in the component costs adds 5 gp to the market price. The cost to create these items is the magic supplies cost and the base XP cost (both determined by the base price) plus the costs for the components. Descriptions of these items include an entry that gives the total cost of creating the item.
The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well-lit place in which to work. Any place suitable for preparing spells is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires one day per 1,000 gp in the item’s base price, with a minimum of at least one day. Potions are an exception to this rule; they always take just one day to brew. The character must spend the gold and XP at the beginning of the construction process.
The caster works for 8 hours each day. He cannot rush the process by working longer each day. But the days need not be consecutive, and the caster can use the rest of his time as he sees fit.
A character can work on only one item at a time. If a character starts work on a new item, all materials used and XP spent on the under-construction item are wasted.
The secrets of creating artifacts are long lost.

Many factors must be considered when determining the price of new magic items. The easiest way to come up with a price is to match the new item to an item that is already priced that price as a guide. Otherwise, use the guidelines summarized on Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values.
Multiple Similar Abilities: For items with multiple similar abilities that don’t take up space on a character’s body use the following formula: Calculate the price of the single most costly ability, then add 75% of the value of the next most costly ability, plus one-half the value of any other abilities.
Multiple Different Abilities: Abilities such as an attack roll bonus or saving throw bonus and a spell-like function are not similar, and their values are simply added together to determine the cost. For items that do take up a space on a character’s body each additional power not only has no discount but instead has a 50% increase in price.
0-Level Spells: When multiplying spell levels to determine value, 0- level spells should be treated as 1/2 level.
Other Considerations: Once you have a final cost figure, reduce that number if either of the following conditions applies:
—Item Requires Skill to Use: Some items require a specific skill to get them to function. This factor should reduce the cost about 10%.
—Item Requires Specific Class or Alignment to Use: Even more restrictive than requiring a skill, this limitation cuts the cost by 30%.
Prices presented in the magic item descriptions (the gold piece value following the item’s caster level) are the market value, which is generally twice what it costs the creator to make the item.
Since different classes get access to certain spells at different levels, the prices for two characters to make the same item might actually be different. An item is only worth two times what the caster of lowest possible level can make it for. Calculate the market price based on the lowest possible level caster, no matter who makes the item.
Not all items adhere to these formulas directly. The reasons for this are several. First and foremost, these few formulas aren’t enough to truly gauge the exact differences between items. The price of a magic item may be modified based on its actual worth. The formulas only provide a starting point. The pricing of scrolls assumes that, whenever possible, a wizard or cleric created it. Potions and wands follow the formulas exactly. Staffs follow the formulas closely, and other items require at least some judgment calls.

MASTERWORK ITEMS
Masterwork items are extraordinarily well-made items. They are more expensive, but they benefit the user with improved quality. They are not magical in any way. However, only masterwork items may be enhanced to become magic armor and weapons. (Items that are not weapons or armor may or may not be masterwork items.)

CREATING MAGIC ARMOR
To create magic armor, a character needs a heat source and some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. He also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the armor or the pieces of the armor to be assembled. Armor to be made into magic armor must be masterwork armor, and the masterwork cost is added to the base price to determine final market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the materials are subsumed in the cost for creating the magic armor—half the base price of the item.
Creating magic armor has a special prerequisite: The creator’s caster level must be at least three times the enhancement bonus of the armor. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.
Magic armor or a magic shield must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus to have any of the abilities listed on Table: Armor Special Abilities and Table: Shield Special Abilities.
If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the armor, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard), must provide any material components or focuses the spells require, and must pay any XP costs required for the spells. The act of working on the armor triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the armor’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)
Creating some armor may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.
Crafting magic armor requires one day for each 1,000 gp value of the base price.
Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Magic Arms and Armor.

CREATING MAGIC WEAPONS
To create a magic weapon, a character needs a heat source and some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. She also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the weapon or the pieces of the weapon to be assembled. Only a masterwork weapon can become a magic weapon, and the masterwork cost is added to the total cost to determine final market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the materials are subsumed in the cost for creating the magic weapon—half the base price given on Table: Weapons, according to the weapon’s total effective bonus.
Creating a magic weapon has a special prerequisite: The creator’s caster level must be at least three times the enhancement bonus of the weapon. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.
A magic weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus to have any of the abilities listed on Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities or Table Ranged Weapon Special Abilities.
If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the weapon, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not provide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the item. The act of working on the weapon triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the weapon’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)
At the time of creation, the creator must decide if the weapon glows or not as a side-effect of the magic imbued within it. This decision does not affect the price or the creation time, but once the item is finished, the decision is binding.
Creating magic double-headed weapons is treated as creating two weapons when determining cost, time, XP, and special abilities.
Creating some weapons may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.
Crafting a magic weapon requires one day for each 1,000 gp value of the base price.
Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Magic Arms and Armor.

CREATING POTIONS
The creator of a potion needs a level working surface and at least a few containers in which to mix liquids, as well as a source of heat to boil the brew. In addition, he needs ingredients. The costs for materials and ingredients are subsumed in the cost for brewing the potion—25 gp x the level of the spell x the level of the caster.
All ingredients and materials used to brew a potion must be fresh and unused. The character must pay the full cost for brewing each potion. (Economies of scale do not apply.)
The imbiber of the potion is both the caster and the target. Spells with a range of personal cannot be made into potions.
The creator must have prepared the spell to be placed in the potion (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and must provide any material component or focus the spell requires.
If casting the spell would reduce the caster’s XP total, he pays the XP cost upon beginning the brew in addition to the XP cost for making the potion itself. Material components are consumed when he begins working, but a focus is not. (A focus used in brewing a potion can be reused.) The act of brewing triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting until the character has rested and regained spells. (That is, that spell slot is expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.) Brewing a potion requires one day.

CREATING RINGS
To create a magic ring, a character needs a heat source. He also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a ring or the pieces of the ring to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the ring. Ring costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the ring prices in the ring descriptions as a guideline. Creating a ring generally costs half the ring’s market price.
Rings that duplicate spells with costly material or XP components add in the value of 50 x the spell’s component cost. Having a spell with a costly component as a prerequisite does not automatically incur this cost. The act of working on the ring triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the ring’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)
Creating some rings may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.
Forging a ring requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.
Item Creation Feat Required: Forge Ring.

CREATING RODS
To create a magic rod, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a rod or the pieces of the rod to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the rod. Rod costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the rod prices in the rod descriptions as a guideline. Creating a rod costs half the market value listed.
If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the rod, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not provide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the item. The act of working on the rod triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the rod’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)
Creating some rods may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.
Crafting a rod requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.
Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Rod.

CREATING SCROLLS
To create a scroll, a character needs a supply of choice writing materials, the cost of which is subsumed in the cost for scribing the scroll—12.5 gp x the level of the spell x the level of the caster.
All writing implements and materials used to scribe a scroll must be fresh and unused. A character must pay the full cost for scribing each spell scroll no matter how many times she previously has scribed the same spell.
The creator must have prepared the spell to be scribed (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and must provide any material component or focus the spell requires. If casting the spell would reduce the caster’s XP total, she pays the cost upon beginning the scroll in addition to the XP cost for making the scroll itself. Likewise, a material component is consumed when she begins writing, but a focus is not. (A focus used in scribing a scroll can be reused.) The act of writing triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting until the character has rested and regained spells. (That is, that spell slot is expended from her currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.)
Scribing a scroll requires one day per each 1,000 gp of the base price.

CREATING STAFFS
To create a magic staff, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a staff or the pieces of the staff to be assembled.
The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the staff—375 gp x the level of the highest-level spell x the level of the caster, plus 75% of the value of the next most costly ability (281.25 gp x the level of the spell x the level of the caster), plus one-half of the value of any other abilities (187.5 gp x the level of the spell x the level of the caster). Staffs are always fully charged (50 charges) when created.
If desired, a spell can be placed into the staff at only half the normal cost, but then activating that particular spell costs 2 charges from the staff. The caster level of all spells in a staff must be the same, and no staff can have a caster level of less than 8th, even if all the spells in the staff are low-level spells.
The creator must have prepared the spells to be stored (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and must provide any focus the spells require as well as material and XP component costs sufficient to activate the spell a maximum number of times (50 divided by the number of charges one use of the spell expends). This is in addition to the XP cost for making the staff itself. Material components are consumed when he begins working, but focuses are not. (A focus used in creating a staff can be reused.) The act of working on the staff triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the staff ’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)
Creating a few staffs may entail other prerequisites beyond spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.
Crafting a staff requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.
Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Staff.

CREATING WANDS
To create a magic wand, a character needs a small supply of materials, the most obvious being a baton or the pieces of the wand to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the wand—375 gp x the level of the spell x the level of the caster. Wands are always fully charged (50 charges) when created.
The creator must have prepared the spell to be stored (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and must provide any focuses the spell requires. Fifty of each needed material component are required, one for each charge. If casting the spell would reduce the caster’s XP total, she pays the cost (multiplied by 50) upon beginning the wand in addition to the XP cost for making the wand itself. Likewise, material components are consumed when she begins working, but focuses are not. (A focus used in creating a wand can be reused.) The act of working on the wand triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting during each day devoted to the wand’s creation. (That is, that spell slot is expended from her currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.)

CREATING WONDROUS ITEMS
To create a wondrous item, a character usually needs some sort of equipment or tools to work on the item. She also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the item. Wondrous item costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the item prices in the item descriptions as a guideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.
If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the item, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not provide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the item. The act of working on the item triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the item’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)
Creating some items may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.
Crafting a wondrous item requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.
Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Wondrous Item.

INTELLIGENT ITEM CREATION
To create an intelligent item, a character must have a caster level of 15th or higher. Time and creation cost are based on the normal item creation rules, with the market price values on Table: Item Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities treated as additions to time, gp cost, and XP cost. The item’s alignment is the same as its creator’s. Determine other features randomly, following the guidelines in the relevant section.

ADDING NEW ABILITIES
A creator can add new magical abilities to a magic item with no restrictions. The cost to do this is the same as if the item was not magical. Thus, a +1 longsword can be made into a +2 vorpal longsword, with the cost to create it being equal to that of a +2 vorpal sword minus the cost of a +1 sword.
If the item is one that occupies a specific place on a character’s body the cost of adding any additional ability to that item increases by 50%. For example, if a character adds the power to confer invisibility to her ring of protection +2, the cost of adding this ability is the same as for creating a ring of invisibility multiplied by 1.5.

BODY SLOT AFFINITIES
Each location on the body, or body slot, has one or more affinities: a word or phrase that describes the general function or nature of magic items designed for that body slot. Body slot affinities are deliberately broad, abstract categorizations, because a hard-and-fast rule can’t cover the great variety among wondrous items.
You can use the affinities in the list below to guide your decisions on which magic items should be allowed in which body slots. And when you design your own magic items, the affinities give you some guidance for what form a particular item should take.
Some body slots have different affinities for different specific items.
Body Slot

Headband, helmet
Mental improvement, ranged attacks

Wondrous items that don’t match the affinity for a particular body slot should cost 50% more than wondrous items that match the affinity.

MAGIC ITEMS II (ARMOR & WEAPONS)

ARMOR
In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than nonmagical armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.
In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A suit of armor with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material.
Armor is always created so that even if the type of armor comes with boots or gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots or gauntlets.

All magic shields are masterwork shields (with an armor check penalty 1 less than normal).

Caster Level for Armor and Shields: The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.
Shields: Shield enhancement bonuses stack with armor enhancement bonuses. Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a bash. The bashing special ability, however, does grant a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls (see the special ability description).
A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC.
As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
Shield Hardness and Hit Points: Each +1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to a shield’s hardness and +10 to its hit points.
Activation: Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields—by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the user needs to activate then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard action).
Armor for Unusual Creatures: The cost of armor for nonhumanoid creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

Magic Armor and Shield Special Ability Descriptions
Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

1 Add to enhancement bonus on Table: Armor and Shields to determine total market price.
2 If you roll a special ability twice, only one counts. If you roll two versions of the same special ability, use the better.

Acid Resistance: A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a dull gray appearance. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of acid damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).
Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.
Acid Resistance, Improved: As acid resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of acid damage per attack.
Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.
Acid Resistance, Greater: As acid resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of acid damage per attack.
Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.
Animated: Upon command, an animated shield floats within 2 feet of the wielder, protecting her as if she were using it herself but freeing up both her hands. Only one shield can protect a character at a time. A character with an animated shield still takes any penalties associated with shield use, such as armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, and nonproficiency.
Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects; Price +2 bonus.
Arrow Catching: A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapons to it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield’s wearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield’s bearer instead. (If the wielder has total cover relative to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted.) Additionally, those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield’s base AC bonus are not diverted to the wearer (but the shield’s increased AC bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder can activate or deactivate this ability with a command word.
Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, entropic shield; Price +1 bonus.
Arrow Deflection: This shield protects the wielder as if he had the Deflect Arrows feat. Once per round when he would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he can make a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. He must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn’t count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or acid arrows, can’t be deflected.
Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shield; Price +2 bonus.
Bashing: A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield bash. A bashing shield deals damage as if it were a weapon of two size categories larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points of damage and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to bash. (Only light and heavy shields can have this ability.)
Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bull’s strength; Price +1 bonus.
Blinding: A shield with this ability flashes with a brilliant light up to twice per day upon command of the wielder. Anyone within 20 feet except the wielder must make a DC 14 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.
Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, searing light; Price +1 bonus.
Cold Resistance: A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a bluish, icy hue or is adorned with furs and shaggy pelts. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of cold damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).
Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.
Cold Resistance, Improved: As cold resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of cold damage per attack.
Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.
Cold Resistance, Greater: As cold resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of cold damage per attack.
Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.
Electricity Resistance: A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a bluish hue and often bears a storm or lightning motif. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of electricity damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).
Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.
Electricity Resistance, Improved: As electricity resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of electricity damage per attack.
Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.
Electricity Resistance, Greater: As electricity resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of electricity damage per attack.
Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.
Etherealness: On command, this ability allows the wearer of the armor to become ethereal (as the ethereal jaunt spell) once per day. The character can remain ethereal for as long as desired, but once he returns to normal, he cannot become ethereal again that day.
Strong transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, ethereal jaunt; Price +49,000 gp.
Fire Resistance: A suit of armor with this ability normally has a reddish hue and often is decorated with a draconic motif. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of fire damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).
Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.
Fire Resistance, Improved: As fire resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of fire damage per attack.
Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.
Fire Resistance, Greater: As fire resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of fire damage per attack.
Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.
Fortification: This suit of armor or shield produces a magical force that protects vital areas of the wearer more effectively. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the wearer, there is a chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.

Ghost Touch: This armor or shield seems almost translucent. Both its enhancement bonus and its armor bonus count against the attacks of incorporeal creatures. It can be picked up, moved, and worn by incorporeal creatures at any time. Incorporeal creatures gain the armor or shield’s enhancement bonus against both corporeal and incorporeal attacks, and they can still pass freely through solid objects.
Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, etherealness; Price +3 bonus.
Glamered: A suit of armor with this ability appears normal. Upon command, the armor changes shape and form to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing. The armor retains all its properties (including weight) when glamered. Only a true seeing spell or similar magic reveals the true nature of the armor when disguised.
Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, disguise self; Price +2,700 gp.
Invulnerability: This suit of armor grants the wearer damage reduction of 5/magic.
Strong abjuration and perhaps evocation (if miracle is used); CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, stoneskin, wish or miracle; Price +3 bonus.
Reflecting: This shield seems like a mirror. Its surface is completely reflective. Once per day, it can be called on to reflect a spell back at its caster exactly like the spell turning spell.
Strong abjuration; CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, spell turning; Price +5 bonus.
Shadow: This armor is jet black and blurs the wearer whenever she tries to hide, granting a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks. (The armor’s armor check penalty still applies normally.)
Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, invisibility; Price +3,750 gp.
Shadow, Improved: As shadow, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Hide checks.
Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, invisibility; Price +15,000 gp.
Shadow, Greater: As shadow, except it grants a +15 competence bonus on Hide checks.
Moderate illusion; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, invisibility; Price +33,750 gp.
Silent Moves: This armor is well oiled and magically constructed so that it not only makes little sound, but it dampens sound around it. It provides a +5 competence bonus on its wearer’s Move Silently checks. (The armor’s armor check penalty still applies normally.)
Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, silence; Price +3,750 gp.
Silent Moves, Improved: As silent moves, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Move Silently checks.
Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, silence; Price +15,000 gp.
Silent Moves, Greater: As silent moves, except it grants a +15 competence bonus on Move Silently checks.
Moderate illusion; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, silence; Price +33,750 gp.
Slick: Slick armor seems coated at all times with a slightly greasy oil. It provides a +5 competence bonus on its wearer’s Escape Artist checks. (The armor’s armor check penalty still applies normally.)
Faint conjuration; CL 4th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, grease; Price +3,750 gp.
Slick, Improved: As slick, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.
Moderate conjuration; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, grease; Price +15,000 gp.
Slick, Greater: As slick, except it grants a +15 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.
Moderate conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, grease; Price +33,750 gp.
Sonic Resistance: A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a glistening appearance. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of sonic damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).
Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +18,000 gp.
Sonic Resistance, Improved: As sonic resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of sonic damage per attack.
Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +42,000 gp.
Sonic Resistance, Greater: As sonic resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of sonic damage per attack.
Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy; Price +66,000 gp.
Spell Resistance: This property grants the armor’s wearer spell resistance while the armor is worn. The spell resistance can be 13, 15, 17, or 19, depending on the armor.
Strong abjuration; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, spell resistance; Price +2 bonus (SR 13), +3 bonus (SR 15), +4 bonus (SR 17), or +5 bonus (SR 19).
Undead Controlling: The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this property may control up to 26 HD of undead per day, as the control undead spell. At dawn each day, the wearer loses control of any undead still under his sway. Armor or a shield with this ability appears to be made of bone; this feature is entirely decorative and has no other effect on the armor.
Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, control undead; Price +49,000 gp.
Wild: The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this ability preserves his armor bonus (and any enhancement bonus) while in a wild shape. Armor and shields with this ability usually appear to be made covered in leaf patterns. While the wearer is in a wild shape, the armor cannot be seen.
Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, baleful polymorph; Price +3 bonus.

Specific Armors
The following specific suits of armor usually are preconstructed with exactly the qualities described here.
Adamantine Breastplate: This nonmagical breastplate is made of adamantine, giving its wearer damage reduction of 2/–.
No aura (nonmagical); Price 10,200 gp.
Banded Mail of Luck: Ten 100-gp gems adorn this +3 banded mail. Once per week, the armor allows its wearer to require that an attack roll made against him be rerolled. He must take whatever consequences come from the second roll. The wearer’s player must decide whether to have the attack roll rerolled before damage is rolled.
Strong enchantment; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bless; Price 18,900 gp; Cost 10,150 gp + 700 XP.
Breastplate of Command: This finely crafted +2 breastplate radiates a powerful aura of magic. When worn, the armor bestows a dignified and commanding aura upon its owner. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, including turning checks and Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his Leadership score. Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal. Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, the wearer cannot hide or conceal herself in any way and still have the effect function.
Strong enchantment; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mass charm monster; Price 25,400 gp; Cost 10,975 gp + 850 XP.
Celestial Armor: This bright silver or gold +3 chainmail is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without betraying its presence. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +8, an armor check penalty of –2, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor, weighs 20 pounds, and it allows the wearer to use fly on command (as the spell) once per day.
Faint transmutation [good]; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be good, fly; Price 22,400 gp; Cost 12,550 gp + 1,004 XP.
Demon Armor: This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. The helmet is shaped to look like a horned demon head, and its wearer looks out of the open, tooth-filled mouth. This +4 full plate allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a contagion spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The “claws” are built into the armor’s vambraces and gauntlets.
The armor bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the armor is worn.
Strong necromancy [evil]; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, contagion; Price 52,260 gp; Cost 26,130 gp + 2,090 XP.
Dragonhide Plate: This suit of full plate is made of dragonhide, rather than metal, so druids can wear it. It is otherwise identical to masterwork full plate.
No aura (nonmagical); Price 3,300 gp.
Dwarven Plate: This full plate is made of adamantine, giving its wearer damage reduction of 3/–.
No aura (nonmagical); Price 16,500 gp.
Elven Chain: This extremely light chainmail is made of very fine mithral links. Speed while wearing elven chain is 30 feet for Medium creatures, or 20 feet for Small. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 20%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +4, and an armor check penalty of –2. It is considered light armor and weighs 20 pounds.
No aura (nonmagical); Price 4,150 gp.
Mithral Full Plate of Speed: As a free action, the wearer of this fine set of +1 mithral full plate can activate it, enabling her to act as though affected by a haste spell for up to 10 rounds each day. The duration of the haste effect need not be consecutive rounds.
Speed while wearing a suit of mithral full plate is 20 feet for Medium creatures, or 15 feet for Small. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +3, and an armor check penalty of –3. It is considered medium armor and weighs 25 pounds.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, haste; Price 26,500 gp.
Mithral Shirt: This extremely light chain shirt is made of very fine mithral links. Speed while wearing a mithral shirt is 30 feet for Medium creatures, or 20 feet for Small. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 10%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +6, and no armor check penalty. It is considered light armor and weighs 10 pounds.
No aura (nonmagical); Price 1,100 gp.
Plate Armor of the Deep: This +1 full plate is decorated with a wave and fish motif. The wearer of plate armor of the deep is treated as unarmored for purposes of Swim checks. The wearer can breathe underwater and can converse with any creature with a language that breathes water.
Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, freedom of movement, water breathing, tongues; Price 24,650 gp; Cost 17,150 gp + 600 XP.
Rhino Hide: This +2 hide armor is made from rhinoceros hide. In addition to granting a +2 enhancement bonus to AC, it has a –1 armor check penalty and deals an additional 2d6 points of damage on any successful charge attack made by the wearer, including a mounted charge.
Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bull’s strength; Price 5,165 gp; Cost 2,665 gp + 200 XP.

Specific Shields
The following specific shields usually are preconstructed with exactly the qualities described here.
Absorbing Shield: This +1 heavy steel shield is flat black and seems to absorb light. Once every two days, on command, it can disintegrate an object that it touches, as the spell but requiring a melee touch attack.
Strong transmutation; CL 17th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, disintegrate; Price 50,170 gp; Cost 25,170 gp + 2,000 XP.
Caster’s Shield: This +1 light wooden shield has a small leather strip on the back on which a spellcaster can scribe a single spell as on a scroll. A spell so scribed has only half the base raw material cost. Experience point and component costs remain the same. The strip cannot accommodate spells of higher than 3rd level. The strip is reusable.
A random caster ’s shield has a 50% chance of having a single medium scroll spell on it. The spell is divine (01–80 on d%) or arcane (81–100).
A caster’s shield has a 5% arcane spell failure chance.
Moderate abjuration; CL 6th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Scribe Scroll, creator must be at least 6th level; Price 3,153 gp (plus the value of the scroll spell if one is currently scribed); Cost 1,653 gp + 120 XP.

WEAPONS
Magic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses to both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonus on attack rolls does not stack with their enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonus applies to either type of attack.
In addition to an enhancement bonus, weapons may have special abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses (except where specifically noted). A single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
A weapon or a kind of ammunition may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material.
Caster Level for Weapons: The caster level of a weapon with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus and no other abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.
Additional Damage Dice: Some magic weapons deal additional dice of damage. Unlike other modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied when the attacker scores a critical hit.
Ranged Weapons and Ammunition: The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two enhancement bonuses applies.
Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already have).
Magic Ammunition and Breakage: When a magic arrow, crossbow bolt, or sling bullet misses its target, there is a 50% chance it breaks or otherwise is rendered useless. A magic arrow, bolt, or bullet that hits is destroyed.
Light Generation: Fully 30% of magic weapons shed light equivalent to a light spell (bright light in a 20-foot radius, shadowy light in a 40-foot radius). These glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. Such a weapon can’t be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.
Hardness and Hit Points: An attacker cannot damage a magic weapon that has an enhancement bonus unless his own weapon has at least as high an enhancement bonus as the weapon or shield struck. Each +1 of enhancement bonus also adds 1 to the weapon’s or shield’s hardness and hit points.
Activation: Usually a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon—by attacking with it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate then the user usually needs to utter a command word (a standard action).
Magic Weapons and Critical Hits: Some weapon qualities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. This special effect functions against creatures not subject to critical hits, such as undead, elementals, and constructs. When fighting against such creatures, roll for critical hits as you would against humanoids or any other creature subject to critical hits. On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon’s regular damage.

Weapons for Unusually Sized Creatures: The cost of weapons for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.
Special Qualities: Roll d%. If the item is a melee weapon, a 01–30 result indicates that the item sheds light, 31–45 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon’s function, and 46–100 indicates no special qualities.
If the item is a ranged weapon, a 01–15 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon’s function, and 16–100 indicates no special qualities.

Magic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions
In addition to enhancement bonuses, weapons can have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
Anarchic: An anarchic weapon is chaotically aligned and infused with the power of chaos. It makes the weapon chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of lawful alignment. It bestows one negative level on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the chaotic power upon their ammunition.
Moderate evocation [chaotic]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, chaos hammer, creator must be chaotic; Price +2 bonus.
Axiomatic: An axiomatic weapon is lawfully aligned and infused with the power of law. It makes the weapon law-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of chaotic alignment. It bestows one negative level on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition.
Moderate evocation [lawful]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, order’s wrath, creator must be lawful; Price +2 bonus.
Bane: A bane weapon excels at attacking one type or subtype of creature. Against its designated foe, its effective enhancement bonus is +2 better than its normal enhancement bonus. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against the foe. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the bane quality upon their ammunition.

Moderate conjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, summon monster I; Price +1 bonus.
Brilliant Energy: A brilliant energy weapon has its significant portion transformed into light, although this does not modify the item’s weight. It always gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A brilliant energy weapon ignores nonliving matter. Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, and objects. This property can only be applied to melee weapons, thrown weapons, and ammunition.
Strong transmutation; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, gaseous form, continual flame; Price +4 bonus.
Dancing: As a standard action, a dancing weapon can be loosed to attack on its own. It fights for 4 rounds using the base attack bonus of the one who loosed it and then drops. While dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity, and the person who activated it is not considered armed with the weapon. In all other respects, it is considered wielded or attended by the creature for all maneuvers and effects that target items. While dancing, it takes up the same space as the activating character and can attack adjacent foes (weapons with reach can attack opponents up to 10 feet away). The dancing weapon accompanies the person who activated it everywhere, whether she moves by physical or magical means. If the wielder who loosed it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it while it is attacking on its own as a free action; when so retrieved the weapon can’t dance (attack on its own) again for 4 rounds.
Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects; Price +4 bonus.
Defending: A defending weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the sword’s enhancement bonus to his AC as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon’s enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the effect to AC lasts until his next turn.
Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shield or shield of faith; Price +1 bonus.
Disruption: A weapon of disruption is the bane of all undead. Any undead creature struck in combat must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be destroyed. A weapon of disruption must be a bludgeoning weapon. (If you roll this property randomly for a piercing or slashing weapon, reroll.)
Strong conjuration; CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, heal; Price +2 bonus.
Distance: This property can only be placed on a ranged weapon. A weapon of distance has double the range increment of other weapons of its kind.
Moderate divination; CL 6th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, clairaudience/clairvoyance; Price +1 bonus.
Flaming: Upon command, a flaming weapon is sheathed in fire. The fire does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A flaming weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the fire energy upon their ammunition.
Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor and flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; Price +1 bonus.
Flaming Burst: A flaming burst weapon functions as a flaming weapon that also explodes with flame upon striking a successful critical hit. The fire does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra fire damage from the flaming ability (see above), a flaming burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of fire damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of fire damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points of fire damage. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the fire energy upon their ammunition.
Even if the flaming ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra fire damage on a successful critical hit.
Strong evocation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor and flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; Price +2 bonus.
Frost: Upon command, a frost weapon is sheathed in icy cold. The cold does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A frost weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the cold energy upon their ammunition.
Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, chill metal or ice storm; Price +1 bonus.
Ghost Touch: A ghost touch weapon deals damage normally against incorporeal creatures, regardless of its bonus. (An incorporeal creature’s 50% chance to avoid damage does not apply to attacks with ghost touch weapons.) The weapon can be picked up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a ghost touch weapon counts as either corporeal or incorporeal at any given time, whichever is more beneficial to the wielder.
Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, plane shift; Price +1 bonus.
Holy: A holy weapon is imbued with holy power. This power makes the weapon good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of evil alignment. It bestows one negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the holy power upon their ammunition.
Moderate evocation [good]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, holy smite, creator must be good; Price +2 bonus.
Icy Burst: An icy burst weapon functions as a frost weapon that also explodes with frost upon striking a successful critical hit. The frost does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra damage from the frost ability, an icy burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of cold damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of cold damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the cold energy upon their ammunition.
Even if the frost ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra cold damage on a successful critical hit.
Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, chill metal or ice storm; Price +2 bonus.
Keen: This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. Only piercing or slashing weapons can be keen. (If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll.) This benefit doesn’t stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon (such as the keen edge spell or the Improved Critical feat).
Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, keen edge; Price +1 bonus.
Ki Focus: The magic weapon serves as a channel for the wielder’s ki, allowing her to use her special ki attacks through the weapon as if they were unarmed attacks. These attacks include the monk’s stunning attack, ki strike, and quivering palm, as well as the Stunning Fist feat. Only melee weapons can have the ki focus ability.
Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be a monk; Price +1 bonus.
Merciful: The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage, and all damage it deals is nonlethal damage. On command, the weapon suppresses this ability until commanded to resume it. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the merciful effect upon their ammunition.
Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, cure light wounds; Price +1 bonus.
Mighty Cleaving: A mighty cleaving weapon allows a wielder with the Cleave feat to make one additional cleave attempt in a round.
Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, divine power; Price +1 bonus.
Returning: This special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be thrown. A returning weapon flies through the air back to the creature that threw it. It returns to the thrower just before the creature’s next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn).
Catching a returning weapon when it comes back is a free action. If the character can’t catch it, or if the character has moved since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, telekinesis; Price +1 bonus.
Seeking: Only ranged weapons can have the seeking ability. The weapon veers toward its target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. (The wielder still has to aim the weapon at the right square. Arrows mistakenly shot into an empty space, for example, do not veer and hit invisible enemies, even if they are nearby.)
Strong divination; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, true seeing; Price +1 bonus.
Shock: Upon command, a shock weapon is sheathed in crackling electricity. The electricity does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A shock weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the electricity energy upon their ammunition.
Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, call lightning or lightning bolt; Price +1 bonus.
Shocking Burst: A shocking burst weapon functions as a shock weapon that also explodes with electricity upon striking a successful critical hit. The electricity does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra electricity damage from the shock ability, a shocking burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of electricity damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of electricity damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the electricity energy upon their ammunition.
Even if the shock ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra electricity damage on a successful critical hit.
Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, call lightning or lightning bolt; Price +2 bonus.
Speed: When making a full attack action, the wielder of a speed weapon may make one extra attack with it. The attack uses the wielder’s full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects, such as a haste spell.)
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, haste; Price +3 bonus.
Spell Storing: A spell storing weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action.) Any time the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. (This special ability is an exception to the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as long as casting that spell normally.) Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it. A randomly rolled spell storing weapon has a 50% chance to have a spell stored in it already.
Strong evocation (plus aura of stored spell); CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be a caster of at least 12th level; Price +1 bonus.
Thundering: A thundering weapon creates a cacophonous roar like thunder upon striking a successful critical hit. The sonic energy does not harm the wielder. A thundering weapon deals an extra 1d8 points of sonic damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d8 points of sonic damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d8 points of sonic damage. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the sonic energy upon their ammunition. Subjects dealt a critical hit by a thundering weapon must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be deafened permanently.
Faint necromancy; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, blindness/deafness; Price +1 bonus.
Throwing: This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A melee weapon crafted with this ability gains a range increment of 10 feet and can be thrown by a wielder proficient in its normal use.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, magic stone; Price +1 bonus.
Unholy: An unholy weapon is imbued with unholy power. This power makes the weapon evil-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of good alignment. It bestows one negative level on any good creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the unholy power upon their ammunition.
Moderate evocation [evil]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, unholy blight, creator must be evil; Price +2 bonus.
Vicious: When a vicious weapon strikes an opponent, it creates a flash of disruptive energy that resonates between the opponent and the wielder. This energy deals an extra 2d6 points of damage to the opponent and 1d6 points of damage to the wielder. Only melee weapons can be vicious.
Moderate necromancy; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, enervation; Price +1 bonus.
Vorpal: This potent and feared ability allows the weapon to sever the heads of those it strikes. Upon a roll of natural 20 (followed by a successful roll to confirm the critical hit), the weapon severs the opponent’s head (if it has one) from its body. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no heads. Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than vampires, are not affected by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die when their heads are cut off. A vorpal weapon must be a slashing weapon. (If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll.)
Strong necromancy and transmutation; CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, circle of death, keen edge; Price +5 bonus.
Wounding: A wounding weapon deals 1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss when it hits a creature. A critical hit does not multiply the Constitution damage. Creatures immune to critical hits (such as plants and constructs) are immune to the Constitution damage dealt by this weapon.
Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mage’s sword; Price +2 bonus.

Specific Weapons
The following specific weapons usually are preconstructed with exactly the qualities described here.
Adamantine Battleaxe: This nonmagical axe is made out of adamantine. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
No aura (nonmagical); Price 3,010 gp.
Adamantine Dagger: This nonmagical dagger is made out of adamantine. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
No aura (nonmagical); Price 3,002 gp.
Assassin’s Dagger: This wicked-looking, curved +2 dagger provides a +1 bonus to the DC of a Fortitude save forced by the death attack of an assassin.
Moderate necromancy; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, slay living; Price 18,302 gp; Cost 9,302 gp + 720 XP.
Dagger of Venom: This black +1 dagger has a serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use a poison effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the poison effect must be invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes.
Faint necromancy; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, poison; Price 8,302 gp; Cost 4,302 gp + 320 XP.
Dwarven Thrower: This weapon commonly functions as a +2 warhammer. In the hands of a dwarf, the warhammer gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus (for a total enhancement bonus of +3) and gains the returning special ability. It can be hurled with a 30-foot range increment. When hurled, it deals an extra 2d8 points of damage against giants or an extra 1d8 points of damage against any other target.
Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be a dwarf of at least 10th level; Price 60,312 gp; Cost 30,312 gp + 2,400 XP.
Flame Tongue: This is a +1 flaming burst longsword. Once per day, the sword can blast forth a fiery ray at any target within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The ray deals 4d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit.
Moderate evocation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, scorching ray, and flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; Price 20,715 gp; Cost 10,515 gp + 816 XP.
Frost Brand: This +3 frost greatsword sheds light as a torch when the temperature drops below 0°F. At such times it cannot be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Its wielder is protected from fire; the sword absorbs the first 10 points of fire damage each round that the wielder would otherwise take.
A frost brand extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. As a standard action, it can also dispel lasting fire spells, but not instantaneous effects, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +14) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.
Strong evocation; CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, ice storm, dispel magic, protection from energy; Price 54,475 gp; Cost 27,375 gp and 5 sp + 2179 XP.
Holy Avenger: This +2 cold iron longsword becomes a +5 holy cold iron longsword in the hands of a paladin.
It provides spell resistance of 5 + the paladin’s level to the wielder and anyone adjacent to her. It also enables the wielder to use greater dispel magic (once per round as a standard action) at the class level of the paladin. (Only the area dispel is possible, not the targeted dispel or counterspell versions of greater dispel magic.)
Strong abjuration; CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, holy aura, creator must be good; Price 120,630 gp; Cost 60,630 gp + 4,800 XP.
Javelin of Lightning: This javelin becomes a 5d6 lightning bolt when thrown (Reflex DC 14 half ). It is consumed in the attack.
Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, lightning bolt; Price 1,500 gp; Cost 750 gp + 30 XP.
Life-Drinker: This +1 greataxe is favored by undead and constructs, who do not suffer its drawback. A life-drinker bestows two negative levels on its target whenever it deals damage, just as if its target had been struck by an undead creature. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose a character level.
Each time a life-drinker deals damage to a foe, it also bestows one negative level on the wielder. Any negative level gained by the wielder in this fashion lasts for 1 hour.
Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, enervation; Price 40,320 gp; Cost 20,320 gp + 1,600 XP.
Luck Blade: This +2 short sword gives its possessor a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. Its possessor also gains the power of good fortune, usable once per day. This extraordinary ability allows its possessor to reroll one roll that she just made. She must take the result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original roll. In addition, a luck blade may contain up to three wishes (when randomly rolled, a luck blade holds 1d4–1 wishes, minimum 0). When the last wish is used, the sword remains a +2 short sword, still grants the +1 luck bonus, and still grants its reroll power.
Strong evocation; CL 17th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, wish or miracle; Price 22,060 gp (0 wishes), 62,360 gp (1 wish), 102,660 gp (2 wishes), 142,960 gp (3 wishes); Cost 11,030 gp + 882 XP (0 wishes), 31,180 gp + 2,494 XP (1 wish); 51,330 gp + 4,106 XP (2 wishes), 71,480 gp + 5,718 XP (3 wishes).
Mace of Smiting: This +3 adamantine heavy mace has a +5 enhancement bonus against constructs, and any critical hit dealt to a construct completely destroys it (no saving throw). A critical hit dealt to an outsider deals x4 damage rather than x2.
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, disintegrate; Price 75,312 gp; Cost 39,312 gp + 2,880 XP.
Mace of Terror: On command, this +2 heavy mace causes the wielder’s clothes and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror such that living creatures in a 30-foot cone become panicked as if by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). They take a –2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they flee from the wielder. The wielder may use this ability up to three times per day.
Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, fear; Price 38,552 gp; Cost 19,276 gp + 1,542 XP.
Masterwork Cold Iron Longsword: This nonmagical longsword is crafted out of cold iron. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
No aura (nonmagical); Price 330 gp.
Nine Lives Stealer: This longsword always performs as a +2 longsword, but it also has the power to draw the life force from an opponent. It can do this nine times before the ability is lost. At that point, the sword becomes a simple +2 longsword (with a hint of evil about it). A critical hit must be dealt for the sword’s death-dealing ability to function, and this weapon has no effect on creatures not subject to critical hits. The victim is entitled to a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid death. If the save is successful, the sword’s death-dealing ability does not function, no use of the ability is expended, and normal critical damage is determined. This sword is evil, and any good character attempting to wield it gains two negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the sword is in hand and disappear when the sword is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the sword is wielded.
Strong necromancy [evil]; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, finger of death; Price 23,057 gp; Cost 11,528 gp 5 sp + 922 XP.
Oathbow: Of elven make, this white +2 composite longbow (+2 Str bonus) whispers “Swift defeat to my enemies” in Elven when nocked and pulled. Once per day, if the firer swears aloud to slay her target (a free action), the bow’s whisper becomes the low shout “Swift death to those who have wronged me.” Against such a sworn enemy, the bow has a +5 enhancement bonus, and arrows launched from it deal an additional 2d6 points of damage (and x4 on a critical hit instead of the normal x3). However, the bow is treated as only a masterwork weapon against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the wielder takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls with any weapon other than the oathbow. These bonuses and penalties last for seven days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder of the oathbow, whichever comes first.
The oathbow may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target or seven days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the oathbow’s special power again until 24 hours have passed from the time he made the oath.
Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be an elf; Price 25,600 gp; Cost 13,100 gp + 1,000 XP.
Rapier of Puncturing: Three times per day, this +2 wounding rapier allows the wielder to make a touch attack with the weapon that deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage by draining blood. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the Constitution damage dealt by this weapon.
Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, harm; Price 50,320 gp; Cost 25,320 gp + 2,000 XP.
Screaming Bolt: One of these +2 bolts screams when fired, forcing all enemies of the wielder within 20 feet of the path of the bolt to succeed on a DC 14 Will save or become shaken. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, doom; Price 267gp; Cost 128 gp and 5 sp + 10 XP.
Shatterspike: Wielders without the Improved Sunder feat use Shatterspike as a +1 longsword only; wielders with the Improved Sunder feat add a +4 bonus (including the sword’s +1 enhancement bonus) to the opposed roll when attempting to strike a foe’s weapon. If successful, Shatterspike deals 1d8+4 points of damage plus the wielder’s Strength modifier to the target weapon (the target weapon’s hardness must still be overcome with each hit). Shatterspike can damage weapons with an enhancement bonus of +4 or lower.
Strong evocation; CL 13th; Str 13, Craft Arms and Armor, Power Attack, Improved Sunder, shatter; Price 4,315 gp; Cost 2,315 gp + 160 XP; Weight 4 lb.
Shifter’s Sorrow: This +1/+1 two-bladed sword has blades of alchemical silver. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against any creature with the shapechanger subtype. When a shapechanger or a creature in an alternate form (such as a druid using wild shape) is struck by the weapon, it must make a DC 15 Will save or return to its natural form.
Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Arms and Armor, baleful polymorph; Price 12,780 gp; Cost 6,780 gp + 480 XP; Weight 10 lb.
Silver Dagger, Masterwork: This masterwork alchemical silver dagger is nonmagical. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
No aura (nonmagical); Price 322 gp.
Slaying Arrow: This +1 arrow is keyed to a particular type or subtype of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or die (or, in the case of unliving targets, be destroyed) instantly. Note that even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude saves (undead and constructs) are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living creature, this is a death effect (and thus death ward protects a target). To determine the type or subtype of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on the table below.
A greater slaying arrow functions just like a normal slaying arrow, but the DC to avoid the death effect is 23.
Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, finger of death (slaying arrow) or heightened finger of death (greater slaying arrow); Price 2,282 gp (slaying arrow) or 4,057 gp (greater slaying arrow); Cost 1,144 gp 5 sp + 91 XP (slaying arrow) or 2,032 gp + 162 XP (greater slaying arrow).

Sleep Arrow: This +1 arrow is painted white and has white fletching. If it strikes a foe so that it would normally deal damage, it instead bursts into magical energy that deals nonlethal damage (in the same amount as would be lethal damage) and forces the target to make a DC 11 Will save or fall asleep.
Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, sleep; Price 132 gp; Cost 69 gp 5 sp + 5 XP.
Sun Blade: This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a sun blade is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. (In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword.) Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack.
In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and x3 on a critical hit instead of the usual x2).
The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above her head while speaking a command word. The sunblade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that is like full daylight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the sword is wielded.
Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, daylight, creator must be good; Price 50,335 gp; Cost 25,335 gp + 2,000 XP.
Sword of Life Stealing: This black iron +2 longsword bestows a negative level when it deals a critical hit. The sword wielder gains 1d6 temporary hit points each time a negative level is bestowed on another. These temporary hit points last for 24 hours. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose a character level.
Strong necromancy; CL 17th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, enervation; Price 25,715 gp; Cost 12,857 gp and 5 sp + 1,029 XP.
Sword of the Planes: This longsword has an enhancement bonus of +1 on the Material Plane, but on any Elemental Plane its enhancement bonus increases to +2. (The +2 enhancement bonus also applies on the Material Plane when the weapon is used against elementals.) It operates as a +3 longsword on the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane or when used against opponents native to either of those planes. On any other plane, or against any outsider, it functions as a +4 longsword.
Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, plane shift; Price 22,315 gp; Cost 11,157 gp and 5 sp + 893 XP.
Sword of Subtlety: A +1 short sword with a thin, dull gray blade, this weapon provides a +4 bonus on its wielder’s attack and damage rolls when he is making a sneak attack with it.
Moderate illusion; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, blur; Price 22,310 gp; Cost 11,155 gp + 892 XP.
Sylvan Scimitar: This +3 scimitar, when used outdoors in a temperate climate, grants its wielder the use of the Cleave feat and deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.
Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, divine power or creator must be a 7th-level druid; Price 47,315gp; Cost 23,657 gp and 5 sp + 1,893 XP.
Trident of Fish Command: The magical properties of this +1 trident with a 6-foot-long haft enable its wielder to charm up to 14 HD of aquatic animals (Will DC 16 negates, animals get a +5 bonus if currently under attack by the wielder or his allies), no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. The wielder can use this effect up to three times per day. The wielder can communicate with the animals as if using a speak with animals spell. Animals making their saving throw are free of control, but they will not approach within 10 feet of the trident. The trident can be used up to three times per day.
Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, speak with animals; Price 18,650 gp; Cost 9,325 gp + 746 XP.
Trident of Warning: A weapon of this type enables its wielder to determine the location, depth, kind, and number of aquatic predators within 680 feet.

MAGIC ITEMS III (POTIONS, RINGS, & RODS)

POTIONS AND OILS
A potion is a magic liquid that produces its effect when imbibed. Magic oils are similar to potions, except that oils are applied externally rather than imbibed. A potion or oil can be used only once. It can duplicate the effect of a spell of up to 3rd level that has a casting time of less than 1 minute.
Potions are like spells cast upon the imbiber. The character taking the potion doesn’t get to make any decisions about the effect —the caster who brewed the potion has already done so. The drinker of a potion is both the effective target and the caster of the effect (though the potion indicates the caster level, the drinker still controls the effect).
The person applying an oil is the effective caster, but the object is the target.
Physical Description: A typical potion or oil consists of 1 ounce of liquid held in a ceramic or glass vial fitted with a tight stopper. The stoppered container is usually no more than 1 inch wide and 2 inches high. The vial has AC 13, 1 hit point, hardness 1, and a break DC of 12. Vials hold 1 ounce of liquid.
Identifying Potions: In addition to the standard methods of identification, PCs can sample from each container they find to attempt to determine the nature of the liquid inside. An experienced character learns to identify potions by memory
—for example, the last time she tasted a liquid that reminded her of almonds, it turned out to be a potion of cure moderate wounds.
Activation: Drinking a potion or applying an oil requires no special skill. The user merely removes the stopper and swallows the potion or smears on the oil. The following rules govern potion and oil use.
Drinking a potion or using an oil on an item of gear is a standard action. The potion or oil takes effect immediately. Using a potion or oil provokes attacks of opportunity. A successful attack (including grappling attacks) against the character forces a Concentration check (as for casting a spell). If the character fails this check, she cannot drink the potion. An enemy may direct an attack of opportunity against the potion or oil container rather than against the character. A successful attack of this sort can destroy the container.
A creature must be able to swallow a potion or smear on an oil. Because of this, incorporeal creatures cannot use potions or oils.
Any corporeal creature can imbibe a potion. The potion must be swallowed. Any corporeal creature can use an oil.
A character can carefully administer a potion to an unconscious creature as a full-round action, trickling the liquid down the creature’s throat. Likewise, it takes a full-round action to apply an oil to an unconscious creature.

Potion Descriptions
The caster level for a standard potion is the minimum caster level needed to cast the spell (unless otherwise specified).

RINGS
Rings bestow magical powers upon their wearers. Only a rare few have charges. Anyone can use a ring.
A character can only effectively wear two magic rings. A third magic ring doesn’t work if the wearer is already wearing two magic rings.
Physical Description: Rings have no appreciable weight. Although exceptions exist that are crafted from glass or bone, the vast majority of rings are forged from metal—usually precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. A ring has AC 13, 2 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 25.
Activation: Usually, a ring’s ability is activated by a command word (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) or it works continually. Some rings have exceptional activation methods, according to their descriptions.
Special Qualities: Roll d%. A result of 01 indicates the ring is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Rings with charges can never be intelligent.

Ring Descriptions
Standard rings are described below.
Animal Friendship: On command, this ring affects an animal as if the wearer had cast charm animal.
Faint enchantment; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, charm animal; Price 10,800 gp.
Blinking: On command, this ring makes the wearer blink, as with the blink spell.
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, blink; Price 27,000 gp.
Chameleon Power: As a free action, the wearer of this ring can gain the ability to magically blend in with the surroundings. This provides a +10 competence bonus on her Hide checks. As a standard action, she can also command the ring to utilize the spell disguise self as often as she wants.
Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, disguise self, invisibility; Price 12,700 gp.
Climbing: This ring is actually a magic leather cord that ties around a finger. It continually grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Climb checks.
Faint transmutatation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in the Climb skill; Price 2,500 gp.
Climbing, Improved: As climbing, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer’s Climb checks.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in the Climb skill; Price 10,000 gp.
Counterspells: This ring might seem to be a ring of spell storing upon first examination. However, while it allows a single spell of 1st through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out of the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer’s part. Once so used, the spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as before) may be placed in it again.
Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Price 4,000 gp.
Djinni Calling: One of the many rings of fable, this “genie” ring is most useful indeed. It serves as a special gate by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Elemental Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless.
Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Forge Ring, gate; Price 125,000 gp.
Elemental Command: All four kinds of elemental command rings are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.
Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can’t attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of him. If the wearer desires, he may forego this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.
Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned who attack the wearer take a –1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws from the extraplanar creature’s attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. He gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapon he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.
The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which his ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that he wears the ring. They show a healthy respect for the wearer if alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if he is strong. If he is weak, they hate and desire to slay him.
The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows:
Element
Saving Throw Penalty
Air
–2 against earth-based effects
Earth
–2 against air- or electricity-based effects
Fire
–2 against water- or cold-based effects
Water
–2 against fire-based effects
In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.
Ring of Elemental Command (Air)
• Feather fall (unlimited use, wearer only)
• Resist energy (electricity) (unlimited use, wearer only)
• Gust of wind (twice per day)
• Wind wall (unlimited use)
• Air walk (once per day, wearer only)
• Chain lightning (once per week)
The ring appears to be a ring of feather falling until a certain condition is met to activate its full potential. It must be reactivated each time a new wearer acquires it.
Ring of Elemental Command (Earth)
• Meld into stone (unlimited use, wearer only)
• Soften earth or stone (unlimited use)
• Stone shape (twice per day)
• Stoneskin (once per week, wearer only)
• Passwall (twice per week)
• Wall of stone (once per day)
The ring appears to be a ring of meld into stone until the established condition is met.
Ring of Elemental Command (Fire)
• Resist energy (fire) (as a major ring of energy resistance [fire])
• Burning hands (unlimited use)
• Flaming sphere (twice per day)
• Pyrotechnics (twice per day)
• Wall of fire (once per day)
• Flame strike (twice per week)
The ring appears to be a major ring of energy resistance (fire) until the established condition is met.
Ring of Elemental Command (Water)
• Water walk (unlimited use)
• Create water (unlimited use)
• Water breathing (unlimited use)
• Wall of ice (once per day)
• Ice storm (twice per week)
• Control water (twice per week)
The ring appears to be a ring of water walking until the established condition is met.
Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Forge Ring, summon monster VI, all appropriate spells; Price 200,000 gp.
Energy Resistance: This reddish iron ring continually protects the wearer from damage from one type of energy—acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (chosen by the creator of the item; determine randomly if found as part of a treasure hoard). Each time the wearer would normally take such damage, subtract the ring’s resistance value from the damage dealt.
A minor ring of energy resistance grants 10 points of resistance. A major ring of energy resistance grants 20 points of resistance. A greater ring of energy resistance grants 30 points of resistance.
Faint (minor or major) or moderate (greater) abjuration; CL 3rd  (minor), 7th (major), or 11th (greater); Forge Ring, resist energy; Price 12,000 gp (minor), 28,000 gp (major), 44,000 gp (greater).
Evasion: This ring continually grants the wearer the ability to avoid damage as if she had evasion. Whenever she makes a Reflex saving throw to determine whether she takes half damage, a successful save results in no damage.
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, jump; Price 25,000 gp.
Feather Falling: This ring is crafted with a feather pattern all around its edge. It acts exactly like a feather fall spell, activated immediately if the wearer falls more than 5 feet.
Faint transmutation; CL 1st; Forge Ring, feather fall; Price 2,200 gp.
Force Shield: An iron band, this simple ring generates a shield-sized (and shield-shaped) wall of force that stays with the ring and can be wielded by the wearer as if it were a heavy shield (+2 AC). This special creation has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance since it is weightless and encumbrance-free. It can be activated and deactivated at will as a free action.
Moderate evocation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, wall of force; Price 8,500 gp.
Freedom of Movement: This gold ring allows the wearer to act as if continually under the effect of a freedom of movement spell.
Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Forge Ring, freedom of movement; Price 40,000 gp.
Friend Shield: These curious rings always come in pairs. A friend shield ring without its mate is useless. Either wearer of one of a pair of the rings can, at any time, command his or her ring to cast a shield other spell with the wearer of the mated ring as the recipient. This effect has no range limitation.
Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Forge Ring, shield other; Price 50,000 gp (for a pair).
Invisibility: By activating this simple silver ring, the wearer can benefit from invisibility, as the spell.
Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, invisibility; Price 20,000 gp.
Jumping: This ring continually allows the wearer to leap about, providing a +5 competence bonus on all his Jump checks.
Faint transmutation; CL 2nd; Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in the Jump skill; Price 2,500 gp.
Jumping, Improved: As jumping, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer’s Jump check.
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in the Jump skill; Price 10,000 gp.
Mind Shielding: This ring is usually of fine workmanship and wrought from heavy gold. The wearer is continually immune to detect thoughts, discern lies, and any attempt to magically discern her alignment.
Faint aburation; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, nondetection; Price 8,000 gp.
Protection: This ring offers continual magical protection in the form of a deflection bonus of +1 to +5 to AC.
Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Forge Ring, shield of faith, caster must be of a level at least three times greater than the bonus of the ring; Price 2,000 gp (ring +1); 8,000 gp (ring +2); 18,000 gp (ring +3); 32,000 gp (ring +4); 50,000 gp (ring +5).
Ram: The ring of the ram is an ornate ring forged of hard metal, usually iron or an iron alloy. It has the head of a ram as its device.
The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance.
The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. (The ram has Strength 25 and is Large.) The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended.
In addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29.
A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.
Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, bull’s strength, telekinesis; Price 8,600 gp.
Regeneration: This white gold ring continually allows a living wearer to heal 1 point of damage per level every hour rather than every day. (This ability cannot be aided by the Heal skill.) Nonlethal damage heals at a rate of 1 point of damage per level every 5 minutes. If the wearer loses a limb, an organ, or any other body part while wearing this ring, the ring regenerates it as the spell. In either case, only damage taken while wearing the ring is regenerated.
Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Forge Ring, regenerate; Price 90,000 gp.
Shooting Stars: This ring has two modes of operation, one for being in shadowy darkness or outdoors at night and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night.
During the night under the open sky or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command.
• Dancing lights (once per hour)
• Light (twice per night)
• Ball lightning (special, once per night)
• Shooting stars (special, three per week)
The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer’s choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the ring wearer controls them in the same fashion (see the dancing lights spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created.
Number of Balls
Damage per Ball
4 lightning balls
1d6 points of damage each
3 lightning balls
2d6 points of damage each
2 lightning balls
3d6 points of damage each
1 lightning ball
4d6 points of damage
Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. (Multiple balls can be released in the same round.)
The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball) in a 5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage.
Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it makes a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes, unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a save or be hit by the projectile.
Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties.
• Faerie fire (twice per day)
• Spark shower (special, once per day)
The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying a metal weapon. Those wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon take 4d8 points of damage.
Strong evocation; CL 12th; Forge Ring, light, faerie fire, fireball, lightning bolt; Price 50,000 gp.
Spell Storing, Minor: A minor ring of spell storing contains up to three levels of spells that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. The user need not provide any material components or focus, or pay an XP cost to cast the spell, and there is no arcane spell failure chance for wearing armor (because the ring wearer need not gesture). The activation time for the ring is same as the casting time for the relevant spell, with a minimum of 1 standard action.
For a randomly generated ring, treat it as a scroll to determine what spells are stored in it. If you roll a spell that would put the ring over the three-level limit, ignore that roll; the ring has no more spells in it. (Not every newly discovered ring need be fully charged.)
A spellcaster can cast any spells into the ring, so long as the total spell levels do not add up to more than three. Metamagic versions of spells take up storage space equal to their spell level modified by the metamagic feat. A spellcaster can use a scroll to put a spell into the minor ring of spell storing.
The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells currently stored within it.
Faint evocation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Price 18,000 gp.
Spell Storing: As the minor ring of spell storing, except it holds up to five levels of spells.
Moderate evocation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Price 50,000 gp.
Spell Storing, Major: As the minor ring of spell storing, except it holds up to ten levels of spells.
Strong evocation; CL 17th; Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Price 200,000 gp.
Spell Turning: Up to three times per day on command, this simple platinum band automatically reflects the next nine levels of spells cast at the wearer, exactly as if spell turning had been cast upon the wearer.
Strong abjuration; CL 13th; Forge Ring, spell turning; Price 98,280 gp.
Sustenance: This ring continually provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind, so that its wearer needs only sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. The ring must be worn for a full week before it begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another week to reattune it to himself.
Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Forge Ring, create food and water; Price 2,500 gp.
Swimming: This silver ring has a wave pattern etched into the band. It continually grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Swim checks.
Faint transmutation; CL 2nd; Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in the Swim skill; Price 2,500 gp.
Swimming, Improved: As swimming, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer’s Swim checks.
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in the Swim skill; Price 10,000 gp.
Telekinesis: This ring allows the caster to use the spell telekinesis on command.
Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, telekinesis; Price 75,000 gp.
Three Wishes: This ring is set with three rubies. Each ruby stores a wish spell, activated by the ring. When a wish is used, that ruby disappears. For a randomly generated ring, roll 1d3 to determine the remaining number of rubies. When all the wishes are used, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.
Strong evocation (if miracle is used); CL 20th; Forge Ring, wish or miracle; Price 97,950 gp; Cost 11,475 gp + 15,918 XP.
Water Walking: This ring, set with an opal, allows the wearer to continually utilize the effects of the spell water walk.
Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, water walk; Price 15,000 gp.
Wizardry: This special ring comes in four kinds (ring of wizardry I, ring of wizardry II, ring of wizardry III, and ring of wizardry IV), all of them useful only to arcane spellcasters. The wearer’s arcane spells per day are doubled for one specific spell level. A ring of wizardry I doubles 1st-level spells, a ring of wizardry II doubles 2nd-level spells, a ring of wizardry III doubles 3rd-level spells, and a ring of wizardry IV doubles 4th-level spells. Bonus spells from high ability scores or school specialization are not doubled.
Moderate (wizardry I) or strong (wizardry II–IV) (no school); CL 11th (I), 14th (II), 17th (III), 20th (IV); Forge Ring, limited wish; Price 20,000 gp (I), 40,000 gp (II), 70,000 gp (III), 100,000 gp (IV).
X-Ray Vision: On command, this ring gives its possessor the ability to see into and through solid matter. Vision range is 20 feet, with the viewer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead blocks the vision.
Using the ring is physically exhausting, causing the wearer 1 point of Constitution damage per minute after the first 10 minutes of use in a single day.
Moderate divination; CL 6th; Forge Ring, true seeing; Price 25,000 gp.

RODS
Rods are scepterlike devices that have unique magical powers and do not usually have charges. Anyone can use a rod.
Physical Description: Rods weigh approximately 5 pounds.
They range from 2 feet to 3 feet long and are usually made of iron or some other metal. (Many, as noted in their descriptions, can function as light maces or clubs due to their sturdy construction.)
These sturdy items have AC 9, 10 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 27.
Activation: Details relating to rod use vary from item to item. See the individual descriptions for specifics.
Special Qualities: Roll d%. A 01 result indicates the rod is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes.
Rods with charges can never be intelligent.

Rod Descriptions
Although all rods are generally scepterlike, their configurations and abilities run the magical gamut. Standard rods are described below.
Absorption: This rod acts as a magnet, drawing spells or spell-like abilities into itself. The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character possessing the rod or her gear. The rod then nullifies the spell’s effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell’s level as the rod absorbs that spell’s energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.
A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared, without expending the preparation itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in hand when casting. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod’s energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.
A rod of absorption absorbs a maximum of fifty spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod’s remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy.
To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: On a result of 71–100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within.
Strong abjuration; CL 15th;Craft Rod, spell turning; Price 50,000 gp.
Alertness: This rod is indistinguishable from a +1 light mace. It has eight flanges on its macelike head. The rod bestows a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks. If grasped firmly, the rod enables the holder to use detect evil, detect good, detect chaos, detect law, detect magic, discern lies, light, or see invisibility. Each different use is a standard action.
If the head of a rod of alertness is planted in the ground, and the possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creature within 120 feet who intends to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a prayer spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of possible danger from the unfriendly creature or creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an animate objects spell, utilizing any eleven (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground. Objects remain animated for 11 rounds. The rod can perform this function once per day.
Moderate abjuration, divination, enchantment, and evocation; CL 11th; Craft Rod, alarm, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, discern lies, light, see invisibility, prayer, animate objects; Price 85,000 gp.
Cancellation: This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. The item touched must make a DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder’s Will save bonus in place of its own if the holder’s is better. In such cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by wish or miracle. (If a sphere of annihilation and a rod of cancellation negate each other, nothing can restore either of them.)
Strong abjuration; CL 17th; Craft Rod, mage’s disjunction; Price 11,000 gp.
Enemy Detection: This device pulses in the wielder’s hand and points in the direction of any creature or creatures hostile to the bearer of the device (nearest ones first). These creatures can be invisible, ethereal, hidden, disguised, or in plain sight. Detection range is 60 feet. If the bearer of the rod concentrates for a full round, the rod pinpoints the location of the nearest enemy and indicates how many enemies are within range. The rod can be used three times each day, each use lasting up to 10 minutes. Activating the rod is a standard action.
Moderate divination; CL 10th; Craft Rod, true seeing; Price 23,500 gp.
Flailing: Upon the command of its possessor, the rod activates, changing from a normal-seeming rod to a +3 dire flail. The dire flail is a double weapon, which means that each of the weapon’s heads can be used to attack. The wielder can gain an extra attack (with the second head) at the cost of making all attacks at a –2 penalty (as if she had the Two-Weapon Fighting feat).
Once per day the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant her a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws for 10 minutes. The rod need not be in weapon form to grant this benefit.
Transforming it into a weapon or back into a rod is a move action.
Moderate enchantment; CL 9th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bless; Price 50,000 gp.
Flame Extinguishing: This rod can extinguish Medium or smaller nonmagical fires with simply a touch (a standard action). For the rod to be effective against other sorts of fires, the wielder must expend 1 or more of the rod’s charges.
Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire, or a magic fire of Medium or smaller (such as that of a flaming weapon or a burning hands spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those of a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell.
When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by fireball, flame strike, or wall of fire, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod.
If the device is used upon a fire creature (a melee touch attack), it deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges.
A rod of flame extinguishing has 10 charges when found. Spent charges are renewed every day, so that a wielder can expend up to 10 charges in any 24-hour period.
Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Rod, pyrotechnics; Price 15,000 gp.
Immovable Rod: This rod is a flat iron bar with a small button on one end. When the button is pushed (a move action), the rod does not move from where it is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus, the owner can lift or place the rod wherever he wishes, push the button, and let go. Several immovable rods can even make a ladder when used together (although only two are needed). An immovable rod can support up to 8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature pushes against an immovable rod, it must make a DC 30 Strength check to move the rod up to 10 feet in a single round.
Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Rod, levitate; Price 5,000 gp.
Lordly Might: This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts. It also has several more mundane uses. The rod of lordly might is metal, thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. (Pushing any of the rod’s buttons is equivalent to drawing a weapon.) It weighs 10 pounds.
The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.
• Hold person upon touch, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power and then succeed on a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.
• Fear upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action.
• Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half ) and cure the wielder of a like amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with hold person.
The following weapon functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.
• In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +2 light mace.
• When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +1 flaming longsword. A blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the sword’s hilt. The weapon lengthens to an overall length of 4 feet.
• When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 battleaxe. A wide blade springs forth at the ball, and the whole lengthens to 4 feet.
• When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 shortspear or +3 longspear. The spear blade springs forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder’s choice), for an overall length of from 6 feet to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance.
The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.
• Climbing pole/ladder. When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars three inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5.
• The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod’s base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12.
• When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder a knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.
Strong enchantment, evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; CL 19th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, inflict light wounds, bull’s strength, flame blade, hold person, fear; Price 70,000 gp.
Metal and Mineral Detection: This rod pulses in the wielder’s hand and points to the largest mass of metal within 30 feet. However, the wielder can concentrate on a specific metal or mineral. If the specific mineral is within 30 feet, the rod points to any places it is located, and the rod wielder knows the approximate quantity as well. If more than one deposit of the specified metal or mineral is within range, the rod points to the largest cache first. Each operation requires a full-round action.
Moderate divination; CL 9th; Craft Rod, locate object; Price 10,500 gp.
Metamagic Rods: Metamagic rods hold the essence of a metamagic feat but do not change the spell slot of the altered spell. All the rods described here are use-activated (but casting spells in a threatened area still draws an attack of opportunity). A caster may only use one metamagic rod on any given spell, but it is permissible to combine a rod with metamagic feats possessed by the rod’s wielder. In this case, only the feats possessed by the wielder adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast.
Possession of a metamagic rod does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the ability to use the given feat a specified number of times per day. A sorcerer still must take a full-round action when using a metamagic rod, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses.
Lesser and Greater Metamagic Rods: Normal metamagic rods can be used with spells of 6th level or lower. Lesser rods can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower, while greater rods can be used with spells of 9th level or lower.
Metamagic, Empower: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that are empowered as though using the Empower Spell feat.
Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Empower Spell; Price 9,000 gp (lesser), 32,500 gp (normal), 73,000 gp (greater).
Metamagic, Enlarge: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that are enlarged as though using the Enlarge Spell feat.
Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Enlarge Spell; Price 3,000 gp (lesser), 11,000 gp (normal), 24,500 gp (greater).
Metamagic, Extend: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that are extended as though using the Extend Spell feat.
Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Extend Spell; Price 3,000 gp (lesser), 11,000 gp (normal), 24,500 gp (greater).
Metamagic, Maximize: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that are maximized as though using the Maximize Spell feat.
Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Maximize Spell feat; Price 14,000 gp (lesser), 54,000 gp (normal), 121,500 gp (greater).
Metamagic, Quicken: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that are quickened as though using the Quicken Spell feat.
Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Quicken Spell; Price 35,000 gp (lesser), 75,500 gp (normal), 170,000 gp (greater).
Metamagic, Silent: The wielder can cast up to three spells per day without verbal components as though using the Silent Spell feat.
Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Silent Spell; Price 3,000 gp (lesser), 11,000 gp (normal), 24,500 gp (greater).
Negation: This device negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items. The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a greater dispel magic spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod wielder needs to have used a ready action. The dispel check uses the rod’s caster level (15th). The target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can’t negate artifacts (even minor artifacts). The rod can function three times per day.
Strong varied; CL 15th; Craft Rod, dispel magic, and limited wish or miracle; Price 37,000 gp.
Python: This rod is longer than normal rods. It is about 4 feet long and weighs 10 pounds. It strikes as a +1/+1 quarterstaff. If the user throws the rod to the ground (a standard action), it grows to become a giant constrictor snake by the end of the round. The python obeys all commands of the owner. (In animal form, it retains the +1 enhancement bonus on attacks and damage possessed by the rod form.) The serpent returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 100 feet from the owner. If the snake form is slain, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated again for three days. A python rod only functions if the possessor is good.
Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, baleful polymorph, creator must be good; Price 13,000 gp.
Rulership: This rod looks like a royal scepter worth at least 5,000 gp in materials and workmanship alone. The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 120 feet when she activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 300 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher are entitled to a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be used for 500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous.
Strong enchantment; CL 20th; Craft Rod, mass charm monster; Price 60,000 gp; Cost 27,500 gp + 2,200 XP.
Security: This item creates a nondimensional space, a pocket paradise. There the rod’s possessor and as many as 199 other creatures can stay in complete safety for a period of time, up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures affected. All fractions are rounded down.
In this pocket paradise, creatures don’t age, and natural healing take place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and vegetables only) are in abundance. The climate is comfortable for all creatures involved.
Activating the rod (a standard action) causes the wielder and all creatures touching the rod to be transported instantaneously to the paradise. Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise maintain physical contact, allowing all connected creatures in a circle or a chain to be affected by the rod. Unwilling creatures get a DC 17 Will save to negate the effect. If such a creature succeeds on its save, other creatures beyond that point in a chain can still be affected by the rod.
When the rod’s effect expires or is dispelled, all the affected creatures instantly reappear in the location they occupied when the rod was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the space required for reentry. The rod’s possessor can dismiss the effect whenever he wishes before the maximum time period expires, but the rod can only be activated once per week.
Strong conjuuration; CL 20th; Craft Rod, gate; Price 61,000 gp.
Splendor: The possessor of this rod gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Charisma score for as long as she holds or carries the item. Once per day, the rod creates and garbs her in clothing of the finest fabrics, plus adornments of furs and jewels.
Apparel created by the magic of the rod remains in existence for 12 hours. However, if the possessor attempts to sell or give away any part of it, to use it for a spell component, or the like, all the apparel immediately disappears. The same applies if any of it is forcibly taken from her.
The value of noble garb created by the rod ranges from 7,000 to 10,000 gp (1d4+6 x1,000 gp)—1,000 gp for the fabric alone, 5,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for the jewel trim (maximum of twenty gems, maximum value 200 gp each).
In addition, the rod has a second special power, usable once per week. Upon command, it creates a palatial tent—a huge pavilion of silk 60 feet across. Inside the tent are temporary furnishings and food suitable to the splendor of the pavilion and sufficient to entertain as many as one hundred persons. The tent and its trappings last for one day. At the end of that time, the tent and all objects associated with it (including any items that were taken out of the tent) disappear.
Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Rod, eagle’s splendor, fabricate, major creation; Price 25,000 gp.
Thunder and Lightning: Constructed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of a +2 light mace. Its other magical powers are as follows.
• Thunder: Once per day, the rod can strike as a +3 light mace, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod’s impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.
• Lightning: Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a +2 light mace (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack hit, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still applies. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.
• Thunderclap: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a shout spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds).
• Lightning Stroke: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt (9d6 points of electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half ) to a range of 200 feet.
• Thunder and Lightning: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap described above with a lightning bolt, as in the lightning stroke. The thunderclap affects all within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.
Moderate evocation; CL 9th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, lightning bolt, shout; Price 33,000 gp.
Viper: This rod strikes as a +2 heavy mace. Once per day, upon command, the head of the rod becomes that of an actual serpent for 10 minutes. During this period, any successful strike with the rod deals its usual damage and also poisons the creature hit. The poison deals 1d10 points of Constitution damage immediately (Fortitude DC 14 negates) and another 1d10 points of Constitution damage 1 minute later (Fortitude DC 14 negates). The rod only functions if its possessor is evil.
Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, poison, creator must be evil; Price 19,000 gp.
Withering: A rod of withering acts as a +1 light mace that deals no hit point damage. Instead, the wielder deals 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage to any creature she touches with the rod (by making a melee touch attack). If she scores a critical hit, the damage from that hit is permanent ability drain. In either case, the defender negates the effect with a DC 17 Fortitude save.
Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, contagion; Price 25,000 gp.
Wonder: A rod of wonder is a strange and unpredictable device that randomly generates any number of weird effects each time it is used. (Activating the rod is a standard action.) Typical powers of the rod include the following.

MAGIC ITEMS IV (SCROLLS, STAFFS, & WANDS)

SCROLLS
A scroll is a spell (or collection of spells) that has been stored in written form. A spell on a scroll can be used only once. The writing vanishes from the scroll when the spell is activated. Using a scroll is basically like casting a spell.
Physical Description: A scroll is a heavy sheet of fine vellum or high-quality paper. An area about 8 1/2 inches wide and 11 inches long is sufficient to hold one spell. The sheet is reinforced at the top and bottom with strips of leather slightly longer than the sheet is wide. A scroll holding more than one spell has the same width (about 8 1/2 inches) but is an extra foot or so long for each extra spell. Scrolls that hold three or more spells are usually fitted with reinforcing rods at each end rather than simple strips of leather. A scroll has AC 9, 1 hit point, hardness 0, and a break DC of 8.
To protect it from wrinkling or tearing, a scroll is rolled up from both ends to form a double cylinder. (This also helps the user unroll the scroll quickly.) The scroll is placed in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. Most scroll cases are inscribed with magic symbols which often identify the owner or the spells stored on the scrolls inside. The symbols often hide magic traps.
Activation: To activate a scroll, a spellcaster must read the spell written on it. Doing so involves several steps and conditions.
Decipher the Writing: The writing on a scroll must be deciphered before a character can use it or know exactly what spell it contains. This requires a read magic spell or a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level).
Deciphering a scroll to determine its contents does not activate its magic unless it is a specially prepared cursed scroll. A character can decipher the writing on a scroll in advance so that he or she can proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use the scroll.
Activate the Spell: Activating a scroll requires reading the spell from the scroll. The character must be able to see and read the writing on the scroll. Activating a scroll spell requires no material components or focus. (The creator of the scroll provided these when scribing the scroll.) Note that some spells are effective only when cast on an item or items. In such a case, the scroll user must provide the item when activating the spell. Activating a scroll spell is subject to disruption just as casting a normally prepared spell would be. Using a scroll is like casting a spell for purposes of arcane spell failure chance.
To have any chance of activating a scroll spell, the scroll user must meet the following requirements.
• The spell must be of the correct type (arcane or divine). Arcane spellcasters (wizards, sorcerers, and bards) can only use scrolls containing arcane spells, and divine spellcasters (clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers) can only use scrolls containing divine spells. (The type of scroll a character creates is also determined by his or her class.)
• The user must have the spell on his or her class list.
• The user must have the requisite ability score.
If the user meets all the requirements noted above, and her caster level is at least equal to the spell’s caster level, she can automatically activate the spell without a check. If she meets all three requirements but her own caster level is lower than the scroll spell’s caster level, then she has to make a caster level check (DC = scroll’s caster level + 1) to cast the spell successfully. If she fails, she must make a DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid a mishap (see Scroll Mishaps, below). A natural roll of 1 always fails, whatever the modifiers.
Determine Effect: A spell successfully activated from a scroll works exactly like a spell prepared and cast the normal way. Assume the scroll spell’s caster level is always the minimum level required to cast the spell for the character who scribed the scroll (usually twice the spell’s level, minus 1), unless the caster specifically desires otherwise.
The writing for an activated spell disappears from the scroll.
Scroll Mishaps: When a mishap occurs, the spell on the scroll has a reversed or harmful effect. Possible mishaps are given below.
• A surge of uncontrolled magical energy deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level to the scroll user.
• Spell strikes the scroll user or an ally instead of the intended target, or a random target nearby if the scroll user was the intended recipient.
• Spell takes effect at some random location within spell range.
• Spell’s effect on the target is contrary to the spell’s normal effect.
• The scroll user suffers some minor but bizarre effect related to the spell in some way. Most such effects should last only as long as the original spell’s duration, or 2d10 minutes for instantaneous spells.
• Some innocuous item or items appear in the spell’s area.
• Spell has delayed effect. Sometime within the next 1d12 hours, the spell activates. If the scroll user was the intended recipient, the spell takes effect normally. If the user was not the intended recipient, the spell goes off in the general direction of the original recipient or target, up to the spell’s maximum range, if the target has moved away.
Several arcane spells are different in level for sorcerers and wizards than they are for bards. Such spells appear on the table at the level appropriate to a sorcerer or wizard (considered the default because bards typically don’t involve themselves
in scribing scrolls).
Likewise, some divine spells are different in level for clerics and druids than they are for paladins and rangers. Such spells appear at the level appropriate to a cleric or druid (considered the default because paladins and rangers typically don’t involve themselves in scribing scrolls).
If a divine spell is cast at different levels by clerics and druids, it appears at the level appropriate to a cleric (considered the default choice between clerics and druids).
Many spells are either arcane or divine, depending on the class of the caster. Such spells appear on both lists at the level appropriate to the class of the arcane or divine caster.

STAFFS
A staff is a long shaft of wood that stores several spells. Unlike wands, which can contain a wide variety of spells, each staff is of a certain kind and holds specific spells. A staff has 50 charges when created.
Physical Description: A typical staff is 4 feet to 7 feet long and 2 inches to 3 inches thick, weighing about 5 pounds. Most staffs are wood, but a rare few are bone, metal, or even glass. (These are extremely exotic.) Staffs often have a gem or some device at their tip or are shod in metal at one or both ends. Staffs are often decorated with carvings or runes. A typical staff is like a walking stick, quarterstaff, or cudgel. It has AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 24.
Activation: Staffs use the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a staff is usually a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the spell being cast, however, has a longer casting time than 1 standard action, it takes that long to cast the spell from a staff.) To activate a staff, a character must hold it forth in at least one hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for nonhumanoid creatures).
Special Qualities: Roll d%. A 01–30 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the staff ’s function, and 31–100 indicates no special qualities.

Staff Descriptions
Staffs use the wielder’s ability score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their spells. Unlike with other sorts of magic items, the wielder can use his caster level when activating the power of a staff if it’s higher than the caster level of the staff.
This means that staffs are far more potent in the hands of a powerful spellcaster. Because they use the wielder’s ability score to set the save DC for the spell, spells from a staff are often harder to resist than ones from other magic items, which use the minimum ability score required to cast the spell.  Not only are aspects of the spell dependant on caster level (range, duration, and so on) potentially higher, but spells from a staff are harder to dispel and have a better chance of overcoming a target’s spell resistance.
Furthermore, a staff can hold a spell of any level, unlike a wand, which is limited to spells of 4th level or lower. The minimum caster level of a staff is 8th. Standard staffs are described below.

• Globe of invulnerability (2 charges)
The wielder of a staff of power gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and saving throws. The staff is also a +2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff causes double damage (x3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.
A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot radius. All within 2 squares of the broken staff take points of damage equal to 8 x the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take 6 x the number of charges in damage, and those 5 or 6 squares distant take 4 x the number of charges in damage. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.
The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.
After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2 quarterstaff. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a retributive strike.)

WANDS
A wand is a thin baton that contains a single spell of 4th level or lower. Each wand has 50 charges when created, and each charge expended allows the user to use the wand’s spell one time. A wand that runs out of charges is just a stick.
Physical Description: A typical wand is 6 inches to 12 inches long and about 1/4 inch thick, and often weighs no more than 1 ounce. Most wands are wood, but some are bone. A rare few are metal, glass, or even ceramic, but these are quite exotic. Occasionally, a wand has a gem or some device at its tip, and most are decorated with carvings or runes. A typical wand has AC 7, 5 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 16.
Activation: Wands use the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a wand is usually a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the spell being cast, however, has a longer casting time than 1 action, it takes that long to cast the spell from a wand.) To activate a wand, a character must hold it in hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for nonhumanoid creatures) and point it in the general direction of the target or area. A wand may be used while grappling or while swallowed whole.
Special Qualities: Roll d%. A 01–30 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the wand’s function, and 31–100 indicates no special qualities.

MAGIC ITEMS V (WONDROUS ITEMS)

WONDROUS ITEMS
This is a catch-all category for anything that doesn’t fall into the other groups. Anyone can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description).
Physical Description: Varies.
Activation: Usually use activated or command word, but details vary from item to item.
Special Qualities: Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the wondrous item is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes.
Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, greater magic fang, creator’s caster level must be at least three times the amulet’s bonus; Price 6,000 gp (+1), 24,000 gp (+2), 54,000 gp (+3), 96,000 gp (+4), 150,000 gp (+5).
Amulet of Natural Armor: This amulet, usually crafted from bone or beast scales, toughens the wearer’s body and flesh, giving him an enhancement bonus to his natural armor bonus of from +1 to +5, depending on the kind of amulet.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, barkskin, creator’s caster level must be at least three times the amulet’s bonus; Price 2,000 gp (+1), 8,000 gp (+2), 18,000 gp (+3), 32,000 gp (+4), or 50,000 gp (+5).
Amulet of the Planes: This device usually appears to be a black circular amulet, although any character looking closely at it sees a dark, moving swirl of color. The amulet allows its wearer to utilize plane shift. However, this is a difficult item to master. The user must make a DC 15 Intelligence check in order to get the amulet to take her to the plane (and the specific location on that plane) that she wants. If she fails, the amulet transports her and all those traveling with her to a random location on that plane (01–60 on d%) or to a random plane (61–100).
Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift; Price 120,000 gp.
Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location: This silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location just as a nondetection spell does. If a divination spell is attempted against the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the caster had cast nondetection on herself ).
Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, nondetection; Price 35,000 gp.
Apparatus of the Crab: This item appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel, but it has a secret catch (Search DC 20 to locate) that opens a hatch in one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds ten (unlabeled) levers: The device has the following characteristics: hp 200; hardness 15; Spd 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; AC 20 (–1 size, +11 natural); Atk +12 melee (2d8, 2 pincers).

Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since two Medium characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a giant lobster.
Strong evocation and transmutation; CL 19th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, continual flame, creator must have 8 ranks in the Knowledge (architecture and engineering) skill; Price 90,000 gp;Weight 500 lb.
Bag of Holding: This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: Its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag’s contents, depend on the bag’s type, as shown on the table below.

If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action—unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.
If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.
Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest.
Bag of Tricks: This small sack appears normal and empty. However, anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill. Each of the three kinds of a bag of tricks produces a different set of animals. Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.
The heavy warhorse appears with harness and tack and accepts the character who drew it from the bag as a rider.
Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up to ten animals can be drawn from the bag each week.

Bead of Force: This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. You can throw it up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.
It functions like a resilient sphere spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell’s duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.
The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.
Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, resilient sphere; Price 3,000 gp.
Belt, Monk’s: This simple rope belt, when wrapped around a character’s waist, confers great ability in unarmed combat. The wearer’s AC and unarmed damage is treated as a monk of five levels higher. If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the belt lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk. This AC bonus functions just like the monk’s AC bonus.
Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, righteous might or transformation; Price 13,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Belt of Dwarvenkind: This belt gives the wearer a +4 competence bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks as they relate to dealing with dwarves, a +2 competence bonus on similar checks when dealing with gnomes and halflings, and a –2 competence penalty on similar checks when dealing with anyone else. The wearer can understand, speak, and read Dwarven. If the wearer is not a dwarf, he gains 60-foot darkvision, dwarven stonecunning, a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against poison, spells, or spell-like effects.
Moderate divination; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, tongues, creator must be a dwarf; Price 14,900 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Belt of Giant Strength: This wide belt is made of thick leather and studded with iron. The belt adds to the wearer’s Strength score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +4 or +6.
Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, bull’s strength; Price 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6);Weight 1 lb.
Blessed Book: This well-made tome is always of small size, typically no more than 12 inches tall, 8 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. All such books are durable, waterproof, bound with iron overlaid with silver, and locked.
A wizard can fill the 1,000 pages of a blessed book with spells without paying the 100 gp per page material cost. This book is never found as randomly generated treasure with spells already inscribed in it.
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, secret page; Price 12,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Boat, Folding: A folding boat looks like a small wooden box—about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It can be used to store items like any other box. If a command word is given, however, the box unfolds itself to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold to a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.
In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four people comfortably, while the ship carries fifteen with ease.
A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again.
Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate, creator must have 2 ranks in the Craft (shipmaking) skill; Price 7,200 gp;Weight 4 lb.
Boots of Elvenkind: These soft boots enable the wearer to move quietly in virtually any surroundings, granting a +5 competence bonus on Move Silently checks.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be an elf; Price 2,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Boots of Levitation: On command, these leather boots allow the wearer to levitate as if she had cast levitate on herself.
Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, levitate; Price 7,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Boots of Speed: As a free action, the wearer can click her boot heels together, enabling her to act as though affected by a haste spell for up to 10 rounds each day. The duration of the haste effect need not be consecutive rounds.
Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, haste; Price 12,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Boots of Striding and Springing: These boots increase the wearer’s base land speed by 10 feet. In addition to this striding ability (considered an enhancement bonus), these boots allow the wearer to make great leaps. She can jump with a +5 competence bonus on Jump checks.
Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, longstrider, creator must have 5 ranks in the Jump skill; Price 5,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Boots of Teleportation: Any character wearing this footwear may teleport three times per day, exactly as if he had cast the spell of the same name.
Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, teleport; Price 49,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Boots of the Winterlands: This footgear bestows many powers upon the wearer. First, he is able to travel across snow at his normal speed, leaving no tracks. The boots also enable him to travel at normal speed across the most slippery ice (horizontal surfaces only, not vertical or sharply slanted ones) without falling or slipping. Finally, boots of the winterlands warm the wearer, as if he were affected by an endure elements spell.
Faint abjuration and transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, cat’s grace, endure elements, pass without trace; Price 2,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Boots, Winged: These boots appear to be ordinary footgear. On command, the boots sprout wings at the heel and let the wearer fly, without having to maintain concentration, as if affected by a fly spell. He can fly three times day for up to 5 minutes per flight.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, fly; Price 16,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Bottle of Air: This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork. When taken to any airless environment it retains air within it at all times, continually renewing its contents. This means that a character can draw air out of the bottle to breathe. The bottle can even be shared by multiple characters who pass it around. Breathing out of the bottle is a standard action, but a character so doing can then act for as long as she can hold her breath.
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, water breathing; Price 7,250 gp;Weight 2 lb.
Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals: This large container is usually fashioned from blue or green semiprecious stone. It is about 1 foot in diameter, half that deep, and relatively fragile. When the bowl is filled with fresh water, and certain words are spoken, a Large water elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the bowl functions as the summon monster VI spell. Only one elemental can be called at a time. A new elemental requires the bowl to be filled with new water, which cannot happen until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).
If salt water is used, the elemental is Huge rather than Large (as if summon monster VII had been cast).
Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI, summon monster VII; Price 100,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.
Bracelet of Friends: This silver charm bracelet has four charms upon it when created. The owner may designate one person known to him to be keyed to one charm. (This designation takes a standard action, but once done it lasts forever or until changed.) When a charm is grasped and the name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person is called to the spot (a standard action) along with his or her gear, as long as the owner and the called person are on the same plane. The keyed individual knows who is calling, and the bracelet of friends only functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless. A bracelet found with fewer than four charms is worth 25% less for each missing charm.
Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, refuge; Price 19,000 gp.
Bracers of Archery, Greater: These wristbands look like normal protective wear. The bracers empower the wearer to use any bow (not including crossbows) as if she were proficient in its use. If she already has proficiency with any type of bow, she gains a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls and a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls whenever using that type of bow. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective.
Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Price 25,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Bracers of Archery, Lesser: These wristbands function as greater bracers of archery, except that they grant a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and no bonus on damage rolls.
Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Price 5,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Bracers of Armor: These items appear to be wrist or arm guards. They surround the wearer with an invisible but tangible field of force, granting him an armor bonus of +1 to +8, just as though he were wearing armor. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective.
Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, mage armor, creator’s caster level must be at least two times that of the bonus placed in the bracers; Price 1,000 gp (+1), 4,000 gp (+2), 9,000 gp (+3), 16,000 gp (+4), 25,000 gp (+5), 36,000 gp (+6), 49,000 gp (+7), 64,000 gp (+8);Weight 1 lb.
Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals: This device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals. When a fire is lit in the brazier and the proper summoning words are spoken, a Large fire elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the brazier functions as the summon monster VI spell. If brimstone is added, the elemental is Huge instead of Large, and the brazier works as a summon monster VII spell. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new fire, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).
Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI, summon monster VII; Price 100,000 gp; Weight 5 lb.
Brooch of Shielding: This appears to be a piece of silver or gold jewelry used to fasten a cloak or cape. In addition to this mundane task, it can absorb magic missiles of the sort generated by spell or spell-like ability. A brooch can absorb up to 101 points of damage from magic missiles before it melts and becomes useless.
Faint abjuration; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, shield; Price 1,500 gp.
Broom of Flying: This broom is able to fly through the air as if affected by an overland flight spell (average maneuverability) for up to 9 hours per day (split up as its owner desires). The broom can carry 200 pounds and fly at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed at 30 feet. In addition, the broom can travel alone to any destination named by the owner as long as she has a good idea of the location and layout of that destination. It comes to its owner from as far away as 300 yards when she speaks the command word. The broom of flying has a speed of 40 feet when it has no rider.
Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, overland flight, permanency; Price 17,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Candle of Invocation: Each of these special tapers is dedicated to one of the nine alignments. Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual so doing if the candle’s alignment matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment as the burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks while within 30 feet of the flame.
A cleric whose alignment matches the candle’s operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him, as if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours.
In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a gate spell, the respondent being of the same alignment as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn’t interfere with its magical properties.
Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, gate, creator must be same alignment as candle created; Price 8,400 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.
Candle of Truth: This white tallow candle, when burned, calls into place a zone of truth spell (Will DC 13 negates) in a 5-foot radius centered on the candle. The zone lasts for 1 hour, as the candle burns. If the candle is snuffed before that time, the effect is canceled and the candle ruined.
Faint enchantment; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, zone of truth; Price 2,500 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.
Cape of the Mountebank: On command, this bright red and gold cape allows the wearer to use the magic of the dimension door spell once per day. When he disappears, he leaves behind a cloud of smoke, appearing in a similar fashion at his destination.
Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, dimension door; Price 10,080 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Carpet of Flying: This rug is able to fly through the air as if affected by an overland flight spell of unlimited duration. The size, carrying capacity, and speed of the different carpets of flying are shown on the table below. Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to activate it—if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions.

Censer of Controlling Air Elementals: This 6-inch-wide, 1-inch-high perforated golden vessel resembles a thurible found in a place of worship. If it is filled with incense and lit, summoning words spoken over it summon forth a Large air elemental. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the censer functions as the summon monster VI spell. If incense of meditation is burned within the censer, the air elemental is an elder air elemental instead (as if summon monster IX had just been cast). Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new piece of incense, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).
Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI, summon monster IX; Price 100,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Chaos Diamond: This lustrous gemstone is uncut and about the size of a human fist. The gem grants its possessor the following powers:
• Confusion, lesser
• Magic circle against law
• Word of chaos
• Cloak of chaos
Each power is usable 1d4 times per day. This is rolled for each power individually and the character does not
A nonchaotic character who possesses a chaos diamond gains one negative level. Although this level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the diamond is in the character’s possession and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells).
Strong varied; CL 19th; Craft Wondrous Item, cloak of chaos, magic circle against law, random action, word of chaos, creator must be chaotic; Price 160,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Chime of Interruption: This instrument can be struck once every 10 minutes, and its resonant tone lasts for 3 full minutes.
While the chime is resonating, no spell requiring a verbal component can be cast within a 30-foot radius of it unless the caster can make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the spell’s level).
Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, shout; Price 16,800 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Chime of Opening: A chime of opening is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a wizard of lower than 15th level.
The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck, a clear tone rings forth, and in 1 round the target lock is unlocked, the shackle is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of ten times before it cracks and becomes useless.
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, knock; Price 3,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Circlet of Blasting, Minor: On command, this simple golden headband projects a blast of searing light (3d8 points of damage) once per day.
Faint evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, searing light; Price 6,480 gp.
Circlet of Blasting, Major: On command, this elaborate golden headband projects a blast of searing light (5d8 maximized for 40 points of damage) once per day.
Strong evocation; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, Maximize Spell, searing light; Price 23,760 gp.
Circlet of Persuasion: This silver headband grants a +3 competence bonus on the wearer’s Charisma-based checks.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, eagle’s splendor; Price 4,500 gp.
Cloak of Arachnida: This black garment, embroidered with a weblike pattern in silk, gives the wearer the ability to climb as if a spider climb spell had been placed upon her. In addition, the cloak grants her immunity to entrapment by web spells or webs of any sort—she can actually move in webs at half her normal speed. Once per day, the wearer of this cloak can cast web. She also gains a +2 luck bonus on all Fortitude saves against poison from spiders.
Faint conjuration and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, spider climb, web; Price 14,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Cloak of the Bat: Fashioned of dark brown or black cloth, this cloak bestows a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks. The wearer is also able to hang upside down from the ceiling, like a bat.
By holding the edges of the garment, the wearer is able to fly as per the spell. If he desires, the wearer can actually polymorph himself into an ordinary bat and fly accordingly. (All possessions worn or carried are part of the transformation.) Flying, either with the cloak or in bat form, can be accomplished only in darkness (either under the night sky or in a lightless or near-lightless environment underground). Either of the flying powers is usable for up to 7 minutes at a time, but after a flight of any duration the cloak cannot bestow any flying power for a like period of time.
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, fly, polymorph; Price 26,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Cloak of Charisma: This lightweight and fashionable cloak has a highly decorative silver trim. When in a character’s possession, it adds a +2, +4, or +6 enhancement bonus to her Charisma score.
Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, eagle’s splendor; Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6); Weight 2 lb.
Cloak of Displacement, Minor: This item appears to be a normal cloak, but when worn by a character its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works similar to the displacement spell except that it only grants a 20% miss chance on attacks against the wearer. It functions continually.
Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, displacement; Price 24,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Cloak of Displacement, Major: This item appears to be a normal cloak, but on command its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works just like the displacement spell and lasts for a total of 15 rounds per day, which the wearer can divide up as she sees fit.
Moderate illusion; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Extend Spell, displacement; Price 50,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Cloak of Elvenkind: This cloak of neutral gray cloth is indistinguishable from an ordinary cloak of the same color. However, when worn with the hood drawn up around the head, it gives the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks.
Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility, creator must be an elf; Price 2,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Cloak of Etherealness: This silvery-gray cloak seems to absorb light rather than be illuminated by it. On command, the cloak makes its wearer ethereal (as the ethereal jaunt spell). The effect is dismissible. The cloak works for a total of up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be continuous.
Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, ethereal jaunt; Price 55,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Cloak of the Manta Ray: This cloak appears to be made of leather until the wearer enters salt water. At that time the cloak of the manta ray adheres to the individual, and he appears nearly identical to a manta ray (as the polymorph spell, except that it allows only manta ray form). He gains a +3 natural armor bonus, the ability to breathe underwater, and a swim speed of 60 feet, like a real manta ray.
Although the cloak does not enable the wearer to bite opponents as a manta ray does, it does have a tail spine that can be used to strike at opponents behind the wearer, dealing 1d6 points of damage. This attack can be used in addition to any other attack the character has, using his highest melee attack bonus. The wearer can release his arms from the cloak without sacrificing underwater movement if so desired.
Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, polymorph, water breathing; Price 7,200 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Cloak of Resistance: These garments offer magic protection in the form of a +1 to +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws (Fortitude, Reflex, and Will).
Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, resistance, creator’s caster level must be at least three times the cloak’s bonus; Price 1,000 gp (+1), 4,000 gp (+2), 9,000 gp (+3), 16,000 gp (+4), 25,000 gp (+5);Weight 1 lb.
Crystal Ball: This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. A character can use the device to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell scrying (Will DC 16 negates).
Certain crystal balls have additional powers that can be used through the crystal ball on the target viewed.

Cube of Force: This device is about 3/4 inch across and can be made of ivory, bone, or any hard mineral. It enables its possessor to put up a special wall of force 10 feet on a side around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges, which are renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active, the possessor’s speed is limited to the maximum value given on the table.
When the cube of force is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points of damage drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that they deal. Spells that affect the integrity of the screen also drain extra charges. These spells (given in the list below) cannot be cast into or out of the cube:

Cube of Frost Resistance: This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface). The temperature within this area is always at least 65°F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses into its portable form and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a 10-round period, the cube is destroyed.
Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, protection from energy; Price 27,000 gp.
Cubic Gate: This item is fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a plane, one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item should choose the planes to which the other five sides are keyed.
If a side of the cubic gate is pressed once, it opens a gate to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the gate. It is impossible to open more than one gate at a time.
If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. (The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves).
Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift; Price 164,000 gp.
Darkskull: This skull, carved from ebony, is wholly evil. Wherever the skull goes, the area around it is treated as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin (except that no additional spell effect is tied or fixed to the darkskull).
Moderate evocation [evil]; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, unhallow, creator must be evil; Price 60,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.
Decanter of Endless Water: If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type as well as the volume and velocity.
• “Stream” pours out 1 gallon per round.
• “Fountain” produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round.
• “Geyser” produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons per round.
The geyser effect causes considerable back pressure, requiring the holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked down. The force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage but can only affect one target per round. The command word must be spoken to stop it.
Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, control water; Price 9,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.
Deck of Illusions: This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box. A full deck consists of thirty-four cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a major image of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.)

A randomly generated deck is usually complete (11–100 on d%), but may be discovered (01–10) with 1d20 of its cards missing. If cards are missing, reduce the price by a corresponding amount.
Faint illusion; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, major image; Price 8,100 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.
Dimensional Shackles: These shackles have golden runes traced across their cold iron surface. Any creature bound within them is affected as if a dimensional anchor spell were cast upon her (no save). They fit any Small to Large creature. The DC to break or slip out of the shackles is 30.
Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, dimensional anchor; Price 28,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.
Drums of Panic: These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a 20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). Drums of panic can be used once per day.
Moderate necromancy; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, fear; Price 30,000 gp;Weight 10 lb. for the pair.
Dust of Appearance: This fine powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of blur and displacement. (In this, it works just like the faerie fire spell). The dust also reveals figments, mirror images, and projected images for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a –30 penalty on its Hide checks. The dust’s effect lasts for 5 minutes.
Dust of appearance is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes.
Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, glitterdust; Price 1,800 gp.
Dust of Disappearance: This dust looks just like dust of appearance and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as greater invisibility). Normal vision can’t see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including see invisibility or invisibility purge. Dust of appearance, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by dust of disappearance. Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection.
The greater invisibility bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds.The invisible creature doesn’t know when the duration will end.
Moderate illusion; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, greater invisibility; Price 3,500 gp.
Dust of Dryness: This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed to nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled down, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.
If the dust is employed against an elemental with the water subtype, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving throw succeeds.
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, control water; Price 850 gp.
Dust of Illusion: This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered graphite. Stare at it, however, and the dust changes color and form. Put dust of illusion on a creature, and that creature is affected as if by a disguise self glamer, with the individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 11 Reflex save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours.
Faint illusion; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self; Price 1,200 gp.
Dust of Tracelessness: This normal-seeming dust is actually a magic powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a decade.
A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for 250 feet back into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no magical aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust. Survival checks made to track a quarry across an area affected by this dust have a DC 20 higher than normal.
Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, pass without trace; Price 250 gp.
Efficient Quiver: This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding about twenty arrows. It has three distinct portions, each with a nondimensional space allowing it to store far more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can contain up to sixty objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow. The second slightly longer compartment holds up to eighteen objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as six objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staffs, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can produce any item she wishes, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard. The efficient quiver weighs the same no matter what’s placed inside it.
Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest; Price 1,800 gp;Weight 2 lb.
Efreeti Bottle: This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. A thin stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly. There is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91–100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, the efreeti afterward disappears forever. The other 80% of the time (11–90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti’s death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day’s effect.
Strong conjuration; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VII; Price 145,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Elemental Gem: This gem contains a conjuration spell attuned to a specific Elemental Plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water).
When the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a Large elemental appears as if summoned by a summon nature’s ally spell. The elemental is under the control of the creature that broke the gem.
The coloration of the gem varies with the type of elemental it summons. Air elemental gems are transparent, earth elemental gems are light brown, fire elemental gems are reddish orange, and water elemental gems are blue-green.
Moderate conjuration; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon nature’s ally V; Price 2,250 gp.
Elixir of Fire Breath: This strange elixir bestows upon the drinker the ability to spit gouts of flame. He can breathe fire up to three times, each time dealing 4d6 points of fire damage to a single target up to 25 feet away. The victim can attempt a DC 13 Reflex save for half damage. Unused blasts dissipate 1 hour after the liquid is consumed.
Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, scorching ray; Price 1,100 gp.
Elixir of Hiding: A character drinking this liquid gains an intuitive ability to hide (+10 competence bonus on Hide checks for 1 hour).
Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility; Price 250 gp.
Elixir of Love: This sweet-tasting liquid causes the character drinking it to become charmed with the first creature she sees after consuming the draft (as charm person—the drinker must be a humanoid of Medium or smaller size, Will DC 14 negates). The charm effects wear off in 1d3 hours.
Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, charm person; Price 150 gp.
Elixir of Sneaking: This draught of liquid grants the drinker the ability to walk softly and dampens sound around her slightly, granting a +10 competence bonus on Move Silently checks for 1 hour.
Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, silence; Price 250 gp.
Elixir of Swimming: This elixir bestows swimming ability. An almost imperceptible magic sheath surrounds the drinker, allowing him to glide through the water easily (+10 competence bonus on Swim checks for 1 hour).
Faint illusion; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have 5 ranks in the Swim skill; Price 250 gp.
Elixir of Truth: This elixir forces the individual drinking it to say nothing but the truth for 10 minutes (Will DC 13 negates).
She is compelled to answer any questions put to her in that time, but with each question she is free to make a separate DC 13 Will save. If one of these secondary saves is successful, she doesn’t break free of the truth-compelling enchantment but also doesn’t have to answer that particular question. No more than one question can be asked each round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment.
Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, zone of truth; Price 500 gp.
Elixir of Vision: Drinking this elixir grants the imbiber the ability to notice acute details with great accuracy (+10 competence bonus on Search checks for 1 hour).
Faint divination; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Price 250 gp.
Eversmoking Bottle: This metal urn is identical in appearance to an efreeti bottle, except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the eversmoking bottle is stoppered.
The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round.
Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, pyrotechnics; Price 5,400 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Eyes of Charming: These two crystal lenses fit over the user’s eyes. The wearer is able to use charm person (one target per round) merely by meeting a target’s gaze. Those failing a DC 16 Will save are charmed as per the spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10.
Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Heighten Spell, charm person; Price 56,000 gp for a pair.
Eyes of Doom: These crystal lenses fit over the user’s eyes, enabling him to cast doom upon those around him (one target per round) as a gaze attack, except that the wearer must take a standard action, and those merely looking at the wearer are not affected. Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the doom spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10. However, if the wearer has both lenses, he gains the additional power of a continual deathwatch effect and can use fear (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week.
Moderate necromancy; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, doom, deathwatch, fear; Price 25,000 gp.
Eyes of the Eagle: These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. These lenses grant a +5 competence bonus on Spot checks. Wearing only one of the pair causes a character to become dizzy and, in effect, stunned for 1 round. Thereafter, the wearer can use the single lens without being stunned so long as she covers her other eye. Of course, she can remove the single lens and see normally at any time, or wear both lenses to end or avoid the dizziness.
Faint divination; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, clairaudience/clairvoyance; Price 2,500 gp.
Eyes of Petrification: These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. They allow her to use a petrification gaze attack (Fortitude DC 19 negates) for 10 rounds per day. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, flesh to stone; Price 98,000 gp.
Figurines of Wondrous Power: Each of the several kinds of figurines of wondrous power appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.
If a figurine of wondrous power is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.
Bronze Griffon: When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette.
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 10,000 gp.
Ebony Fly: When animated, an ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a hippogriff but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette.
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 10,000 gp.
Golden Lions: These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for one full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word.
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 16,500 gp.
Ivory Goats: These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:
• The Goat of Traveling: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of one day each week—continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for not less than one day before it can again be used.
• The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.
• The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount, with the statistics of a light warhorse. However, its rider can employ the goat’s horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every two weeks for up to 3 hours per use.
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 21,000 gp.
Marble Elephant: This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine’s owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 17,000 gp.
Obsidian Steed: This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy warhorse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: overland flight, plane shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit.
Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.
Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, etherealness, fly, plane shift; Price 28,500 gp.
Onyx Dog: When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. (It has the scent ability and adds +4 to its Spot and Search checks.) It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can see invisibility. An onyx dog can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner.
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 15,500 gp.
Serpentine Owl: This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears. (Remember the limitations of its Intelligence.)
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Price 9,100 gp.
Silver Raven: This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an animal messenger spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous.
Faint enchantment and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, animal messenger, animate objects; Price 3,800 gp.
Feather Token: Each of these items is a small feather that has a power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below. Each token is usable once.
Anchor: A token useful to moor a craft in water so as to render it immobile for up to one day.
Bird: A token that can be used to deliver a small written message unerringly to a designated target as would a carrier pigeon. The token lasts as long as it takes to carry the message.
Fan: A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.
Swan Boat: A token that forms a swanlike boat capable of moving on water at a speed of 60 feet. It can carry eight horses and gear or thirty-two Medium characters or any equivalent combination. The boat lasts for one day.
Tree: A token that causes a great oak to spring into being (5-foot diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top diameter). This is an instantaneous effect.
Whip: A token that forms into a huge leather whip and wields itself against any opponent desired just like a dancing weapon. The weapon has a +10 base attack bonus, does 1d6+1 points of damage, has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a makes a free grapple attack (with a +15 attack bonus) if it hits. The whip lasts no longer than 1 hour.
Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, major creation; Price 50 gp (anchor), 300 gp (bird), 200 gp (fan), 450 gp (swan boat), 400 gp (tree), 500 gp (whip).
Gauntlets of Ogre Power: These gauntlets are made of tough leather with iron studs running across the back of the hands and fingers. They grant the wearer great strength, adding a +2 enhancement bonus to his Strength score. Both gauntlets must be worn for the magic to be effective.
Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, bull’s strength; Price 4,000 gp;Weight 4 lb.
Gauntlet of Rust: This single metal gauntlet looks rusted and pitted but is actually quite powerful. Once per day, it can affect an object as with the rusting grasp spell. It also completely protects the wearer and her gear from rust (magical or otherwise), including the attack of a rust monster.
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, rusting grasp; Price 11,500 gp;Weight 2 lb.
Gem of Brightness: This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a command word, the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.
• One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges.
• Another command word causes the gem of brightness to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.
• The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.
A newly created gem of brightness has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical.
Faint evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, daylight; Price 13,000 gp.
Gem of Seeing: This finely cut and polished stone is indistinguishable from an ordinary jewel in appearance. When it is gazed through, a gem of seeing enables the user to see as though she were affected by the true seeing spell. A gem of seeing can be used for as much as 30 minutes a day, divided up into periods of minutes or rounds as the user sees fit.
Moderate divination; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Price 75,000 gp.
Gloves of Arrow Snaring: Once snugly worn, these gloves seem to meld with the hands, becoming almost invisible. Twice per day, the wearer can act as if he had the Snatch Arrows feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites for it. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective. At least one hand must be free to take advantage of the magic.
Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, shield; Price 4,000 gp.
Gloves of Dexterity: These thin leather gloves are very flexible and allow for delicate manipulation. They add to the wearer’s Dexterity score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective.
Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, cat’s grace; Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).
Glove of Storing: This device is a simple leather glove. On command, one item held in the hand wearing the glove disappears. The item can weigh no more than 20 pounds and must be able to be held in one hand. While stored, the item has negligible weight. With a snap of the fingers wearing the glove, the item reappears. A glove can only store one item at a time. Storing or retrieving the item is a free action. The item is held in stasis and shrunk down so small within the palm of the glove that it cannot be seen. Spell durations are not suppressed, but continue to expire. If an effect is suppressed or dispelled, the stored item appears instantly.
Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, shrink item; Price 10,000 gp (one glove).
Gloves of Swimming and Climbing: These apparently normal lightweight gloves grant a +5 competence bonus on Swim checks and Climb checks. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, bull’s strength, cat’s grace; Price 6,250 gp.
Goggles of Minute Seeing: The lenses of this item are made of special crystal. When placed over the eyes of the wearer, the lenses enable her to see much better than normal at distances of 1 foot or less, granting her a +5 competence bonus on Search checks to find secret doors, traps, and similar concealed objects. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.
Faint divination; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Price 1,250 gp.
Goggles of Night: The lenses of this item are made of dark crystal. Even though the lenses are opaque, when placed over the eyes of the wearer they enable him to see normally and also grant him 60-foot darkvision. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.
Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, darkvision; Price 12,000 gp.
Golem Manual: A golem manual contains information, incantations and magical power that help a character to craft a golem. The instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on skill checks made to craft the golem’s body. Each manual also holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem, effectively grants the builder use of the Craft Construct feat during the construction of the golem, and grants the character an increase to her caster level for the purpose of crafting a golem. Any golem built using a golem manual does not cost the creator any XP, since the requisite XP are “contained” in the book and “expended” by the book during the creation process.
The spells included in a golem manual require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem’s body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book’s ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated.
Clay Golem Manual: The book contains animate objects, bless, commune, prayer, and resurrection. The reader may treat her caster level as two levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a clay golem. The book supplies 1,540 XP for the creation of a clay golem.
Moderate conjuration, divination, enchantment, and transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 11th, animate objects, commune, prayer, resurrection; Price 12,000 gp; Cost 2,150 gp + 1,712 XP; Weight 5 lb.
Flesh Golem Manual: The book contains animate dead, bull’s strength, geas/quest, and limited wish. The reader may treat her caster level as one level higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a flesh golem. The book supplies 780 XP for the creation of a flesh golem.
Moderate enchantment, necromancy [evil], and transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 8th, animate dead, bull’s strength, geas/quest, limited wish; Price 8,000 gp; Cost 2,050 gp + 944 XP; Weight 5 lb.
Iron Golem Manual: The book contains cloudkill, geas/quest, limited wish, and polymorph any object. The reader may treat her caster level as four levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a iron golem. The book supplies 5,600 XP for the creation of a iron golem.
Strong conjuration, enchantment and transmutation; CL 16th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 16th, cloudkill, geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object; Price 35,000 gp; Cost 3,500 gp + 5,880 XP; Weight 5 lb.

Strong abjuration and enchantment; CL 14th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 14th, antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of stunning; Price 22,000 gp; Cost 2,500 gp + 3,600 XP; Weight 5 lb.
Stone Golem Manual, Greater: The book contains geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object, and slow. The reader may treat her caster level as three levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a stone golem. The book supplies 7,640 XP for the creation of a greater stone golem.
Strong abjuration and enchantment; CL 16th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 16th, antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of stunning; Price 44,000 gp; Cost 2,900 gp + 7,872 XP; Weight 5 lb.
Hand of Glory: This mummified human hand hangs by a leather cord around a character’s neck (taking up space as a magic necklace would). If a magic ring is placed on one of the fingers of the hand, the wearer benefits from the ring as if wearing it herself, and it does not count against her two-ring limit. The hand can wear only one ring at a time. Even without a ring, the hand itself allows its wearer to use daylight and see invisibility each once per day.
Faint varied; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead, daylight, detect invisibility; Price 8,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.
Hand of the Mage: This mummified elf hand hangs by a golden chain around a character’s neck (taking up space as a magic necklace would). It allows the wearer to utilize the spell mage hand at will.
Faint transmutation; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, mage hand; Price 900 gp;Weight 2 lb.
Handy Haversack: A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.
While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power in addition. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.
Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest; Price 2,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.
Harp of Charming: This instrument is a golden, intricately carved harp. When played, it enables the performer to work one suggestion (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) into the music for each 10 minutes of playing if he can succeed on a DC 14 Perform (string instruments) check. If the check fails, the audience cannot be affected by any further performances from the harpist for 24 hours.
Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, suggestion; Price 7,500 gp;Weight 5 lb.
Hat of Disguise: This apparently normal hat allows its wearer to alter her appearance as with a disguise self spell. As part of the disguise, the hat can be changed to appear as a comb, ribbon, headband, cap, coif, hood, helmet, and so on.
Faint illusion; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self; Price 1,800 gp.
Headband of Intellect: This device is a light cord with a small gem set so that it rests upon the forehead of the wearer. The headband adds to the wearer’s Intelligence score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6. This enhancement bonus does not earn the wearer extra skill points when a new level is attained; use the unenhanced Intelligence bonus to determine skill points.
Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, fox’s cunning; Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).
Helm of Brilliance: This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: ten diamonds, twenty rubies, thirty fire opals, and forty opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crownlike, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels’ functions are as follows:
• Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20)
• Ruby: Wall of fire
• Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half )
• Opal: Daylight
The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated.
• It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range.
• The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect.
• The helm provides resistance to fire 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources.
Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.
If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.
Strong varied; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect undead, fireball, flame blade, light, prismatic spray, protection from energy, wall of fire; Price 125,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Helm of Comprehend Languages and Read Magic: Appearing as a normal helmet, a helm of comprehend languages and read magic grants its wearer the ability to understand the spoken words of any creature and to read text in any language and any magical writing. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Decipher Script checks to understand messages written in incomplete, archaic, or exotic forms. Note that understanding a magical text does not necessarily imply spell use.
Faint divination; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, comprehend languages, read magic; Price 5,200 gp; Weight 3 lb.
Helm of Telepathy: The wearer can use detect thoughts at will. Furthermore, he can send a telepathic message to anyone whose surface thoughts he is reading (allowing two-way communication). Once per day, the wearer of the helm can implant a suggestion (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) along with his telepathic message.
Faint divination and enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, suggestion; Price 27,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Helm of Teleportation: A character wearing this device may teleport three times per day, exactly as if he had cast the spell of the same name.
Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, teleport; Price 73,500 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Helm of Underwater Action: The wearer of this helmet can see underwater. Drawing the small lenses in compartments on either side into position before the wearer’s eyes activates the visual properties of the helm, allowing her to see five times farther than water and light conditions would allow for normal human vision. (Weeds, obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the command word is spoken, the helm of underwater action creates a globe of air around the wearer’s head and maintains it until the command word is spoken again, enabling her to breathe freely.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, water breathing; Price 57,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Horn of Blasting: This horn appears to be a normal trumpet. It can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals 5d6 points of sonic damage to creatures within a 40-foot cone and causes them to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (a DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the deafening). Crystalline objects and creatures take 7d6 points of sonic damage, with no save unless they’re held, worn, or carried by creatures (Will DC 16 negates).
If a horn of blasting is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 20% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 10d6 points of damage to the person sounding it.
Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, shout; Price 20,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Horn of Blasting, Greater: This horn functions as a horn of blasting, except that it deals 10d6 points of sonic damage, stuns creatures for 1 round, and deafens them for 4d6 rounds (a DC 19 Fortitude reduces the damage by half and negates the stunning and deafening). Crystalline objects take 16d6 points of sonic damage as described for the horn of blasting. A greater horn of blasting also has a 20% cumulative chance of exploding.
Strong evocation; CL 16th; Craft Wondrous Item, greater shout; Price 70,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Horn of Fog: This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an obscuring mist spell. The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the horn; fog clouds travel 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.
Faint conjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, obscuring mist; Price 2,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Horn of Goodness/Evil: This trumpet adapts itself to its owner, so it produces either a good or an evil effect depending on the owner’s alignment. If the owner is neither good nor evil, the horn has no power whatsoever. If he is good, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against evil. If he is evil, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against good. In either case, this ward lasts for 1 hour. The horn can be blown once per day.
Faint abjuration; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, magic circle against good, magic circle against evil; Price 6,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Horn of the Tritons: This device is a conch shell that can be blown once per day except by a triton which can sound it three times per day. A horn of the tritons can perform any one of the following functions when blown.
• Calm rough waters in a 1-mile radius. This effect dispels a summoned water elemental if it fails a DC 16 Will save.
• Attract 5d4 Large sharks (01–30 on d%), 5d6 Medium sharks (31–80), or 1d10 sea lions (81–100) if the character is in a body of water in which such creatures dwell. The creatures are friendly and obey, to the best of their ability, the one who sounded the horn.
• Causes aquatic creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 within 500 feet to become panicked as if they had been targeted by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). Those who successfully save are shaken for 3d6 rounds.
Any sounding of a horn of the tritons can be heard by all tritons within a 3-mile radius.
Moderate conjuration and transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, fear, summon monster V, control water, creator must be a triton or get construction aid from a triton; Price 15,100 gp; Weight 2 lb.
Horn of Valhalla: This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be normal until someone speaks its command word and blows the horn. Then the horn summons a number of human barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just once every seven days. Roll d% and refer to the table below to see what type of horn is found. The horn’s type determines what barbarians are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a horn of Valhalla but doesn’t have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned.

Horseshoes of Speed: These iron shoes come in sets of four like ordinary horseshoes. When affixed to an animal’s hooves, they increase the animal’s base land speed by 30 feet; this counts as an enhancement bonus. As with other effects that increase speed, jumping distances increase proportionally. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.
Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, haste; Price 3,000 gp;Weight 12 lb. (for four).
Horseshoes of a Zephyr: These four iron shoes are affixed like normal horseshoes. They allow a horse to travel without actually touching the ground. The horse must still run above (always around 4 inches above) a roughly horizontal surface. This means that nonsolid or unstable surfaces can be crossed, and that movement is possible without leaving tracks on any sort of ground. The horse moves at its normal base land speed. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.
Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, levitate; Price 6,000 gp;Weight 4 lb. (for four).
Incense of Meditation: This small rectangular block of sweet smelling incense is visually indistinguishable from nonmagical incense until lit. When it is burning, the special fragrance and pearly-hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 Spellcraft check.
When a divine spellcaster lights a block of incense of meditation and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the Maximize Spell feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat).
Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours.
Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Maximize Spell, bless; Price 4,900 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Instant Fortress: This metal cube is small, but when activated by speaking a command word it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress—even knock spells can’t open the door.
The adamantine walls of instant fortress have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a wish or a miracle, which restores 50 points of damage taken.
The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device’s owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress’s sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half ).
The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.
Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, mage’s magnificent mansion; Price 55,000 gp.
Ioun Stones: These crystalline stones always float in the air and must be within 3 feet of their owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

Regeneration from the pearly white ioun stone works like a ring of regeneration. (It only cures damage taken while the character is using the stone.) The pale lavender and lavender and green stones work like a rod of absorption, but absorbing a spell requires a readied action, and these stones cannot be used to empower spells. Stored spells in the vibrant purple stone must be placed by a spellcaster but can be used by anyone (see ring of minor spell storing).
Moderate varied; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be 12th level.
Iron Bands of Binding: When initially discovered, this very potent item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on the globe.
When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and ruin) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 Escape Artist check. Iron bands of binding are usable once per day.
Strong evocation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, grasping hand; Price 26,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Iron Flask: These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature.
The command word can be given only once per day.
If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A newly discovered bottle might contain any of the following:

Lens of Detection: This circular prism enables its user to detect minute details, granting a +5 bonus on Search checks.
It also aids in following tracks, adding a +5 bonus on Survival checks when tracking. The lens is about 6 inches in diameter and set in a frame with a handle.
Moderate divination; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Price 3,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Lyre of Building: If the proper chords are struck, a single use of this lyre negates any attacks made against all inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the effects of a horn of blasting, a disintegrate spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.
The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, or whatever. The effect produced in but 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring for three days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check. If it fails, she must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a week has passed.

Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book.

Marvelous Pigments: These magic emulsions enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the desired image. One pot of marvelous pigments is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface.
Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can’t be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the pigments. Marvelous pigments cannot create magic items. Objects of value depicted by the pigments —precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on— appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, paste, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp.
Items created are not magical; the effect is instantaneous.
Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, major creation; Price 4,000 gp.
Mask of the Skull: This ivory mask has been fashioned into the likeness of a human skull. Once per day, after it has been worn for at least 1 hour, the mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer’s face. It travels up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch attack against the target based on the wearer’s base attack bonus. If the attack succeeds, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be struck dead, as if affected by a finger of death spell. If the target succeeds on his saving throw, he nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of damage. After attacking (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user. The mask has AC 16, 10 hit points, and hardness 6.
Strong necromancy and transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, finger of death, fly; Price 22,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.
Mattock of the Titans: This digging tool is 10 feet long. Any creature of at least Huge size can use it to loosen or tumble earth or earthen ramparts (a 10-foot cube every 10 minutes). It also smashes rock (a 10-foot cube per hour). If used as a weapon, it is the equivalent of a Gargantuan +3 adamantine warhammer, dealing 4d6 points of base damage.
Strong transmutation; CL 16th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, move earth; Price 23,348 gp; Cost 13,348 gp + 800 XP; Weight 120 lb.
Maul of the Titans: This mallet is 8 feet long. If used as a weapon, it is the equivalent of a +3 greatclub and deals triple damage against inanimate objects. However, the wielder must have a Strength of at least 18 to wield it properly. Otherwise, she takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls.
Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, clenched fist; Price 25,305 gp; Cost 12,305 gp + 480 XP; Weight 160 lb.
Medallion of Thoughts: This appears to be a normal pendant disk hung from a neck chain. Usually fashioned from bronze, copper, or nickel-silver, the medallion allows the wearer to read the thoughts of others, as with the spell detect thoughts.
Faint divination; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts; Price 12,000 gp.
Mirror of Life Trapping: This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has fifteen nonspatial extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).
When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim’s equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror’s owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.
If the mirror’s capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is broken, all victims currently trapped in it are freed.
Strong abjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, imprisonment; Price 200,000 gp;Weight 50 lb.
Mirror of Mental Prowess: This mirror resembles an ordinary looking glass 5 feet tall by 2 feet wide. The possessor who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows.
• Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the owner is within 25 feet of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language.
• View other places as if with clairvoyance, but vision extends even onto other planes if the viewer is sufficiently familiar with them.
• Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she’s still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a scrying spell. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror.
• Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving answers similar to those from the legend lore spell).
Strong conjuration and divination; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, gate, legend lore; Price 175,000 gp; Weight 40 lb.
Mirror of Opposition: This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by speaking a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection in the mirror’s surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and her items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to four times per day.
Strong necromancy; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, clone; Price 92,000 gp;Weight 45 lb.
Necklace of Adaptation: This necklace is a heavy chain with a platinum medallion. The magic of the necklace wraps the wearer in a shell of fresh air, making him immune to all harmful vapors and gases (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, as well as inhaled poisons) and allowing him to breathe, even underwater or in a vacuum.
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, alter self; Price 9,000 gp.
Necklace of Fireballs: This device appears to be nothing but beads on a string, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character’s worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half ).
Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The market price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.
Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed below.

If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.
Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, fireball.
Orb of Storms: This glass sphere is 8 inches in diameter. The possessor can call forth all manner of weather, even supernaturally destructive storms. Once per day she can call upon the orb to use a control weather spell, Once per month, she can conjure a storm of vengeance. The possessor of the orb is continually protected by an endure elements effect.
Strong varied; CL 18th; Craft Wondrous Item, control weather, endure elements, storm of vengeance; Price 48,000 gp;Weight 6 lb.
Pearl of Power: This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a pearl of power enables the possessor to recall any one spell that she had prepared and then cast. The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. The spell must be of a particular level, depending on the pearl. Different pearls exist for recalling one spell per day of each level from 1st through 9th and for the recall of two spells per day (each of a different level, 6th or lower).
Strong transmutation; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be able to cast spells of the spell level to be recalled; Price 1,000 gp (1st), 4,000 gp (2nd), 9,000 gp (3rd), 16,000 gp (4th), 25,000 gp (5th), 36,000 gp (6th), 49,000 gp (7th), 64,000 gp (8th), 81,000 gp (9th), or 70,000 gp (two spells).
Pearl of the Sirines: This normal-seeming pearl is beautiful and worth at least 1,000 gp on that basis alone. If it is clasped firmly in hand or held to the breast while the possessor attempts actions related to the pearl’s powers, she understands and is able to employ the item.
The pearl enables its possessor to breathe in water as if she were in clean, fresh air. Her swim speed is 60 feet, and she can cast spells and act underwater without hindrance.
Moderate abjuration and transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, freedom of movement, water breathing; Price 15,300 gp.
Periapt of Health: The wearer of this blue gem on a silver chain is immune to disease, including supernatural diseases.
Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, remove disease; Price 7,500 gp.
Periapt of Proof against Poison: This item is a brilliant-cut black gem on a delicate silver chain. The wearer is immune to poison, although poisons still active when the periapt is first donned still run their course.
Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, neutralize poison; Price 27,000 gp.
Periapt of Wisdom: Although it appears to be a normal pearl on a light chain, a periapt of wisdom actually increases the possessor’s Wisdom score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6 (depending on the individual item).
Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, owl’s wisdom; Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).
Periapt of Wound Closure: This stone is bright red and dangles on a gold chain. The wearer of this periapt automatically becomes stable if his hit points drop to between –1 and –9 inclusive. The periapt doubles the wearer’s normal rate of healing or allows normal healing of wounds that would not do so normally. Hit point damage that involves bleeding is negated for the wearer of the periapt, but he is still susceptible to damage from bleeding that causes Constitution loss, such as that dealt by a wounding weapon.
Moderate conjuration; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, heal; Price 15,000 gp.
Phylactery of Faithfulness: This item is a small box containing religious scripture affixed to a leather cord and tied around the forehead. There is no mundane way to determine what function this religious item performs until it is worn. The wearer of a phylactery of faithfulness is aware of any action or item that could adversely affect his alignment and his standing with his deity, including magical effects. He acquires this information prior to performing such an action or becoming associated with such an item if he takes a moment to contemplate the act.
Faint divination; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law; Price 1,000 gp.
Phylactery of Undead Turning: This item is a boon to any character able to turn undead, allowing him to do so as if his class level were four levels higher than it actually is.
Moderate necromancy [good]; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, 10th-level cleric; Price 11,000 gp.
Pipes of Haunting: This magic item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. When played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Those within 30 feet who hear the tune must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or become frightened for 4 rounds. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are unaffected. Pipes of haunting can be sounded twice a day.
Faint necromancy; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, scare; Price 6,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Pipes of Pain: These appear to be like any other standard set of pipes with nothing to reveal their true nature. When played by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create a wondrous melody. All within 30 feet must make a DC 14 Will save or be fascinated by the sound. (This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion.)
As soon as the piping stops, all those affected are stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise. Unless a character is in a totally silent area, she takes 1d4 points of damage per round for 2d4 rounds. During this time, damage from sonic attacks is doubled. Thereafter, the least noise causes an affected character to become shaken (except when she is in a totally silent area). This hypersensitivity is a curse and therefore hard to remove (see the bestow curse spell).
Faint enchantment and evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have the bardic music class feature, sound burst; Price 12,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Pipes of the Sewers: These wooden pipes appear ordinary, but if the possessor learns the proper tune, he can attract 1d3 rat swarms if rats are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot distance the rats have to travel, there is a 1-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 Perform (wind instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piper’s telepathic commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately. If they are called again within a day, the Perform check DC is 15.
If the rats are under the control of another creature, add the HD of the controller to the Perform check DC. Once control is assumed, another check is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is actively seeking to reassert its control.
Faint conjuration; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, charm animal, summon nature’s ally I, wild empathy ability; Price 1,150 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Pipes of Sounding: When played by a character who has the Perform (wind instruments) skill, these pipes create a variety of sounds. The figment sounds are the equivalent of ghost sound (caster level 2nd).
Faint illusion; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, ghost sound; Price 1,800 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Portable Hole: A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of starlight. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains.
The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled. Each portable hole opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the portable hole and bag of holding being destroyed in the process.
Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift; Price 20,000 gp.
Restorative Ointment: A jar of this unguent is 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch deep and contains five applications. Placed upon a poisoned wound or swallowed, the ointment detoxifies any poison (as neutralize poison). Applied to a diseased area, it removes disease (as remove disease). Rubbed on a wound, the ointment cures 1d8+5 points of damage (as cure light wounds).
Faint conjuration; CL 5th;Craft Wondrous Item, cure light wounds, neutralize poison, remove disease; Price 4,000 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.
Ring Gates: These always come in pairs—two iron rings, each about 18 inches in diameter. The rings must be on the same plane of existence and within 100 miles of each other to function. Whatever is put through one ring comes out the other, and up to 100 pounds of material can be transferred each day. (Objects only partially pushed through and then retracted do not count.) This useful device allows for instantaneous transport of items or messages, and even attacks. A character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a ring gate. A Small character can make a DC 13 Escape Artist check to slip through. Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size can pass through easily. Each ring has a “entry side” and an “exit side,” both marked with appropriate symbols.
Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, gate; Price 40,000 gp;Weight 1 lb. each.
Robe of the Archmagi: This normal-appearing garment can be white (01–45 on d%, good alignment), gray (46–75, neither good nor evil alignment), or black (76–100, evil alignment). Its wearer, if an arcane spellcaster, gains the following powers.
• +5 armor bonus to AC.
• Spell resistance 18.
• +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws.
• +2 enhancement bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance.
If a white robe is donned by an evil character, she immediately gains three negative levels. The reverse is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good character. An evil or good character who puts on a gray robe, or a neutral character who dons either a white or black robe, gains two negative levels. While these negative levels never result in lost levels, they remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells).
Strong varied; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, antimagic field, mage armor or shield of faith, creator must be of same alignment as robe; Price 75,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Robe of Blending: When this robe is put on, the wearer intuitively knows that the garment has very special properties. A robe of blending enables its wearer to appear to be part of his surroundings. This allows him a +10 competence bonus on Hide checks. The wearer can adopt the appearance of another creature, as with the disguise self spell, at will. All creatures acquainted with and friendly to the wearer see him normally.
Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self; Price 30,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Robe of Bones: This handy item functions much like a robe of useful items for the serious necromancer. It appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small embroidered figures representing undead creatures. Only the wearer of the robe can see the embroidery and recognize them for the creatures they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached each round. Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature (see the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the wearer of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked, turned, or destroyed. A newly created robe of bones always has two embroidered figures of each of the following undead:
• Small goblin skeleton
• Medium human commoner skeleton
• Medium wolf skeleton
• Small goblin zombie
• Medium human commoner zombie
• Medium wolf zombie
Moderate necromancy [evil]; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead; Price 2,400 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Robe of Eyes: This valuable garment appears to be a normal robe until it is put on. Its wearer is able to see in all directions at the same moment due to scores of visible, magical eyelike patterns that adorn the robe. She also gains 120-foot darkvision.
The robe of eyes sees all forms of invisible or ethereal things within 120 feet.
The wearer of a robe of eyes gains a +10 competence bonus on Search checks and Spot checks. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed, and she can’t be flanked. However, she is not able to avert her eyes or close her eyes when confronted by a creature with a gaze attack.
A light or continual flame spell cast directly on a robe of eyes causes it to be blinded for 1d3 minutes. A daylight spell blinds it for 2d4 minutes.
Moderate divination; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Price 120,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Robe of Scintillating Colors: The wearer of this robe can cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem in sparkling rainbows of dazzling light. The colors daze those near the wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1 full round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to start flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern effect.
Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the wearer better concealment. The miss chance on attacks against the wearer starts at 10% and increases by 10% each round until it reaches 50% (total concealment).
The robe illuminates a 30-foot radius continuously.
The effect can be used no more than a total of 10 rounds per day.
Moderate illusion; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, blur, rainbow pattern; Price 27,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Robe of Stars: This garment is typically black or dark blue and embroidered with small white or silver stars. The robe has three magical powers.
• It enables its wearer to travel physically to the Astral Plane, along with all that she is wearing or carrying.
• It gives its wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws.
• Its wearer can use up to six of the embroidered stars on the chest portion of the robe as +5 shuriken. The robe grants its wearer proficiency with such weapons. Each shuriken disappears after it is used.
Strong varied; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, magic missile, astral projection or plane shift; Price 58,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Robe of Useful Items: This appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small cloth patches of various shapes. Only the wearer of the robe can see these patches, recognize them for what items they become, and detach them. One patch can be detached each round. Detaching a patch causes it to become an actual item, as indicated below. A newly created robe of useful items always has two each of the following patches:
• Dagger
• Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)
• Mirror (a highly polished 2-foot-by-4-foot steel mirror)
• Pole (10-foot length)
• Hempen rope (50-foot coil)
• Sack
In addition, the robe has several other patches. Roll 4d4 for the number of other patches and then roll for each patch on the table below to determine its nature.

Rope of Climbing: A 60-foot-long rope of climbing is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 10 feet per round, attaching itself securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner.
A rope of climbing can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are untied but lowers the DC of Climb checks while using it by 10. A creature must hold one end of the rope when its magic is invoked.
Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, animate rope; Price 3,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Rope of Entanglement: A rope of entanglement looks just like any other hempen rope about 30 feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes forward 20 feet or upward 10 feet to entangle a victim. An entangled creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check.
The rope has AC 22, 12 hit points, and hardness 10, and it has damage reduction 5/slashing as well. The rope repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a rope of entanglement is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed.
Moderate transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, animate rope, entangle; Price 21,000 gp; Weight 5 lb.
Salve of Slipperiness: This substance provides a +20 competence bonus on all Escape Artist checks, meaning that it is almost impossible to grapple such a character or to tie or chain him up. In addition, such obstructions as webs (magical or otherwise) do not affect an anointed individual. Magic ropes and the like do not avail against this salve. If it is smeared on a floor or on steps, the area should be treated as a long-lasting grease spell. The salve requires 8 hours to wear off normally, or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine).
Salve of slipperiness is needed to coat the inside of a container that is meant to hold sovereign glue (see below).
Faint conjuration; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, grease; Price 1,000 gp.
Scabbard of Keen Edges: This scabbard is fashioned from cured leather and fine silver. It can shrink or enlarge to accommodate any knife, dagger, sword, or similar weapon up to and including a greatsword. Up to three times per day on command, the scabbard casts keen edge on any blade placed within it.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, keen edge; Price 16,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.
Scarab of Protection: This device appears to be a silver medallion in the shape of a beetle. If it is held for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface letting the holder know that it is a protective device.
The scarab’s possessor gains spell resistance 20. The scarab can also absorb energy-draining attacks, death effects, and negative energy effects. Upon absorbing twelve such attacks, the scarab turns to powder and is destroyed.
Strong abjuration and necromancy; CL 18th; Craft Wondrous Item, death ward, spell resistance; Price 38,000 gp.
Scarab, Golembane: This beetle-shaped pin enables its wearer to detect any golem within 60 feet, although he must concentrate (a standard action) in order for the detection to take place. A scarab enables its possessor to combat golems with weapons, unarmed attacks, or natural weapons as if those golems had no damage reduction.
Moderate divination; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect magic, creator must be at least 10th level; Price 2,500 gp.
Shrouds of Disintegration: These burial wrappings look to be made of fine, embroidered materials. When a body is placed inside, a command word will turn it to dust. The magic of the shrouds is usable only once, after which the wrappings become ordinary, fine cloth.
Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, disintegrate; Price 6,600 gp; Weight 10 lb.
Silversheen: This substance can be applied to a weapon as a standard action. It will give the weapon the properties of alchemical silver for 1 hour, replacing the properties of any other special material it might have. One vial will coat a single melee weapon or 20 units of ammunition.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item; Price 250 gp.
Slippers of Spider Climbing: When worn, a pair of these slippers enable movement on vertical surfaces or even upside down along ceilings, leaving the wearer’s hands free. Her speed is 20 feet. Severely slippery surfaces—icy, oiled, or greased surfaces— make these slippers useless. The slippers can be used for 10 minutes per day, split up as the wearer chooses.
Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, spider climb; Price 4,800 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.
Sovereign Glue: This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of salve of slipperiness, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the salve of slipperiness must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of sovereign glue, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8–1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask’s capacity taken up by the salve of slipperiness. One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when universal solvent is applied to the bond. (Sovereign glue is dissolved by universal solvent.)
Strong transmutation; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, make whole; Price 2,400 gp (per ounce).
Stone of Alarm: This stone cube, when given the command word, affixes itself to any object. If that object is touched thereafter by anyone who does not first speak that same command word, the stone emits a piercing screech for 1 hour that can be heard up to a quarter-mile away (assuming no intervening barriers).
Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, alarm; Price 2,700 gp;Weight 2 lb.
Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals: A stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped bit of roughly polished rock.
The possessor of such a stone need but utter a few words of summoning, and a Huge earth elemental comes to the summoner. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak, and in all ways the stone functions as the summon monster VII spell. (If sand or rough, unhewn stone is the summoning medium, the elemental that comes is Large instead, and the stone functions as the summon monster VI spell.) The elemental appears in 1d4 rounds. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new patch of earth or stone, which cannot be accessed until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).
Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI, summon monster VII; Price 100,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.
Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone): This stone is typically a bit of rough polished agate or some similar mineral. Its possessor gains a +1 luck bonus on saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.
Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, divine favor; Price 20,000 gp.
Stone Horse: Each item of this nature appears to be a fullsized, roughly hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden and even to attack as if it were a real horse of the appropriate kind.
A stone horse can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or feed. Damage dealt to it can be repaired by first using a stone to flesh spell, thus causing the stone horse to become a normal horse that can be healed normally. When fully healed, it automatically reverts to its stone form. While in its stone form, it can be fed gems, healing 1 point of damage for each 50 gp worth of mineral it is given.
There are two sorts of stone horses.
Courser: This item has the statistics of a heavy horse as well as having hardness 10.
Destrier: This item has the statistics of a heavy warhorse as well as having hardness 10.
Strong transmutation; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, flesh to stone, animate objects; Price 10,000 gp (courser) or 14,800 gp (destrier);Weight 6,000 lb.
Stone Salve: This ointment has two uses. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a petrified creature, it returns the creature to flesh as the stone to flesh spell. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a nonpetrified creature, it protects the creature as a stoneskin spell.
Strong abjuration and transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, flesh to stone, stoneskin; Price 4,000 gp per ounce.
Strand of Prayer Beads: This item appears to be a normal string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell. Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and how to activate them. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power.
Special Bead Type
Special Bead Ability
Bead of blessing
Wearer can cast bless.
Bead of healing
Wearer can cast his choice of cure serious wounds, remove blindness/deafness, or remove disease.
Bead of karma
Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes.
Bead of smiting
Wearer can cast chaos hammer, holy smite, order’s wrath, or unholy blight (Will DC 17 partial).
Bead of summons
Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for one day. (If the wearer uses the bead of summons to summon a deity’s emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character’s items and places a geas upon him as punishment in the very least.)
Bead of wind walking
Wearer can cast wind walk.
A lesser strand of prayer beads has a bead of blessing and a bead of healing. A strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, and a bead of smiting. A greater strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, a bead of summons, and a bead of wind walking.
Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the bead of summons, which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The beads of blessing, smiting, and wind walking function as spell trigger items; the beads of karma and summons can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the strand of prayer beads in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person.
The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: bead of blessing –600 gp, bead of healing –9,000 gp, bead of karma –20,000 gp, bead of smiting –16,800 gp, bead of summons –20,000 gp, bead of wind walking –46,800 gp.
Faint, moderate or strong (many schools); CL 1st (blessing), 5th (healing), 7th (smiting), 9th (karma), 11th (wind walking), 17th (summons); Craft Wondrous Items and one of the following spells per bead, as appropriate: bless (blessing); cure serious wounds, remove blindness/ deafness, or remove disease (healing); righteous might (karma); gate (summons); chaos hammer, holy smite, order’s wrath, or unholy blight (smiting), wind walk (wind walking); Price 9,600 gp (lesser), 25,800 gp (standard), 95,800 gp (greater).
Sustaining Spoon: This unremarkable eating utensil is typically fashioned from horn. If the spoon is placed in an empty container the vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel. Although this substance has a flavor similar to that of warm, wet cardboard, it is highly nourishing and contains everything necessary to sustain any herbivorous, omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon can produce sufficient gruel each day to feed up to four humans.
Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, create food and water; Price 5,400 gp.
Tome of Clear Thought: This heavy book contains instruction on improving memory and logic, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, she gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to her Intelligence score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book. Because the tome of clear thought provides an inherent bonus, the reader will earn extra skill points when she attains a new level.
Strong evocation (if miracle is used); CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, miracle or wish; Price 27,500 gp (+1), 55,000 gp (+2), 82,500 gp (+3), 110,000 gp (+4), 137,500 gp (+5); Cost 1,250 gp + 5,100 XP (+1), 2,500 gp + 10,200 XP (+2), 3,750 gp + 15,300 XP (+3), 5,000 gp + 20,400 XP (+4), 6,250 gp + 25,500 XP (+5); Weight 5 lb.
Tome of Leadership and Influence: This ponderous book details suggestions for persuading and inspiring others, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, he gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to his Charisma score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book.
Strong evocation (if miracle is used); CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, miracle or wish; Price 27,500 gp (+1), 55,000 gp (+2), 82,500 gp (+3), 110,000 gp (+4), 137,500 gp (+5); Cost 1,250 gp + 5,100 XP (+1), 2,500 gp + 10,200 XP (+2), 3,750 gp + 15,300 XP (+3), 5,000 gp + 20,400 XP (+4), 6,250 gp + 25,500 XP (+5); Weight 5 lb.
Tome of Understanding: This thick book contains tips for improving instinct and perception, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, she gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to her Wisdom score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book.
Strong evocation (if miracle is used); CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, miracle or wish; Price 27,500 gp (+1), 55,000 gp (+2), 82,500 gp (+3), 110,000 gp (+4), 137,500 gp (+5); Cost 1,250 gp + 5,100 XP (+1), 2,500 gp + 10,200 XP (+2), 3,750 gp + 15,300 XP (+3), 5,000 gp + 20,400 XP (+4), 6,250 gp + 25,500 XP (+5); Weight 5 lb.
Unguent of Timelessness: When applied to any matter that was once alive this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time. Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically removed (by dispelling the effect, for instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller objects. A Large object counts as two Medium objects, and a Huge object counts as two Large objects.
Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Prerequisite: Craft Wondrous Item; Price 150 gp.
Universal Solvent: This substance has the unique property of being able to dissolve sovereign glue and tanglefoot bags. Applying the solvent is a standard action.
Strong transmutation; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, disintegrate; Price 50 gp.
Vest of Escape: Hidden within secret pockets of this simple silk vest are lockpicks that provide a +4 competence bonus on Open Lock checks. The vest also grants its wearer a +6 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.
Faint conjuration and transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, knock, grease; Price 5,200 gp.
Vestment, Druid’s: This light garment is worn over normal clothing or armor. Most such vestments are green, embroidered with plant or animal motifs. When this item is worn by a character with the wild shape ability, the character can use that ability one additional time each day.
Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, polymorph or wild shape ability; Price 10,000 gp.
Well of Many Worlds: This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a portable hole. Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world—a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, the random factor again comes into play. It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a portable hole can be. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily as from the initiating place. (It is a two-way portal.)
Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, gate; Price 82,000 gp.
Wind Fan: A wind fan appears to be nothing more than a wood and papyrus or cloth instrument with which to create a cooling breeze. By uttering the command word, its possessor causes the fan to generate air movement duplicating a gust of wind spell. The fan can be used once per day with no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a 20% cumulative chance per usage during that day that the device tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.
Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, gust of wind; Price 5,500 gp.
Wings of Flying: A pair of these wings might appear to be nothing more than a plain cloak of old, black cloth, or they could be as elegant as a long cape of blue feathers. When the wearer speaks the command word, the cloak turns into a pair of bat or bird wings that empower her to fly with a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability).
Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, fly; Price 54,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.

MAGIC ITEMS VI (INTELLIGENT, CURSED, & ARTIFACTS)

INTELLIGENT ITEMS
Magic items sometimes have intelligence of their own. Magically imbued with sentience, these items think and feel the same way characters do and should be treated as NPCs. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to single-use items or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence.
Intelligent items can actually be considered creatures because they have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Treat them as constructs. Intelligent items often have the ability to illuminate their surroundings at will (as magic weapons do); many cannot see otherwise.
Unlike most magic items, intelligent items can activate their own powers without waiting for a command word from their owner. Intelligent items act during their owner’s turn in the initiative order.

INTELLIGENT ITEM ALIGNMENT
Any item with intelligence has an alignment. Note that intelligent weapons already have alignments, either stated or by implication.  If you’re generating a random intelligent weapon, that weapon’s alignment must fit with any alignment-oriented special abilities it has.
Any character whose alignment does not correspond to that of the item (except as noted by the asterisks on the table) gains one negative level if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this negative level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells). This negative level is cumulative with any other penalties the item might already place on inappropriate wielders. Items with Ego scores (see below) of 20 to 29 bestow two negative levels. Items with Ego scores of 30 or higher bestow three negative levels.

Choose one
* The purpose of the neutral (N) version of this item is to preserve the balance by defeating/slaying powerful beings of the extreme alignments (LG, LE, CG, CE).

Purpose
An item’s purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item and should always be treated reasonably. A purpose of “defeat/slay arcane spellcasters” doesn’t mean that the sword forces the wielder to kill every wizard she sees. Nor does it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard, sorcerer, and bard in the world. It does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and wants to bring the local wizard’s cabal to ruin, as well as end the rule of a sorceress-queen in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of “defend elves” doesn’t mean that if the wielder is an elf, he only wants to help himself. It means that the item wants to be used in furthering the cause of elves, stamping out their enemies and aiding their leaders. A purpose of “defeat/slay all” isn’t just a matter of self-preservation. It means that the item won’t rest (or let its wielder rest) until it places itself above all others.

DEDICATED POWER
A dedicated power operates only when an intelligent item is in pursuit of its special purpose. This determination is always made by the item. It should always be easy and straightforward to see how the ends justify the means. Unlike its other powers, an intelligent item can refuse to use its dedicated power even if the owner is dominant (see Items against Characters, below).

Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an item possesses. Only after all aspects of an item have been generated can its Ego score be calculated. An item’s Ego score helps determine whether the item or the character is dominant in their relationship, as detailed below.

ITEMS AGAINST CHARACTERS
When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is, of course, absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment’s goals or the item’s special purpose, personality conflict—item against character—results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with the item.
When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = item’s Ego). If the possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for one day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character’s desires and demands concessions such as any of the following.
• Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.
• The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.
• Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.
• Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.
• Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is not in use.
• That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.
• That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.
In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following acts:
• Force its possessor into combat.
• Refuse to strike opponents.
• Strike at its wielder or her associates.
• Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.
• Cause itself to drop from the character’s grasp.

Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character’s and item’s alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals.
All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are rivals of each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract their host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior.
Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters who possess them, even though they may never successfully control their possessors. They may be powerless to force their demands but remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and demands.

CURSED ITEMS
Cursed items are magic items with some sort of potentially negative impact. Sometimes they’re directly bad for the user; sometimes they’re just inconvenient. Occasionally they mix bad with good, forcing characters to make difficult choices.

Delusion: The user believes the item is what it appears to be, yet it actually has no magical power other than to deceive. The user is mentally fooled into thinking the item is functioning and cannot be convinced otherwise without the help of a remove curse spell.
Opposite Effect or Target: These cursed items malfunction, so that either they do the opposite of what the creator intended, or they target the user instead of someone else. The interesting point to keep in mind here is that these items aren’t always bad to have. Opposite-effect items include weapons that impose penalties on attack and damage rolls rather than bonuses. Just as a character shouldn’t necessarily immediately know what the enhancement bonus of a noncursed magic item is, she shouldn’t immediately know that a weapon is cursed. Once she knows, however, the item can be discarded unless some sort of compulsion is placed upon it that compels the wielder to keep and use it. In such cases, a remove curse spell is generally needed to get rid of the item.
Intermittent Functioning: The three varieties of intermittent functioning items all function perfectly as described—at least some of the time. The three varieties are unreliable, dependent, and uncontrolled items.
Unreliable: Each time the item is activated, there is a 5% chance (01–05 on d%) that it does not function.
Dependent: The item only functions in certain situations. To determine what the situation is, either select a situation or roll on the following table.

Uncontrolled: An uncontrolled item occasionally activates at random times. Roll d% every day. On a result of 01–05 the item activates at some random point during that day.
Requirement: In a sense, a command word is a requirement. Nevertheless, some items have much more stringent requirements that must be met for them to be usable. To keep an item with this kind of curse functioning, one or more of the following conditions must be met.
• Character must eat twice as much as normal.
• Character must sleep twice as much as normal.
• Character must undergo a specific quest (one time only, and then item functions normally thereafter).
• Character must sacrifice (destroy) 100 gp worth of valuables per day.
• Character must sacrifice (destroy) 2,000 gp worth of magic items each week.
• Character must swear fealty to a particular noble or his family.
• Character must discard all other magic items.
• Character must worship a particular deity.
• Character must change her name to a specific name. (The item only works for characters of that name.)
• Character must add a specific class at the next opportunity if not of that class already.
• Character must have a minimum number of ranks in a particular skill.
• Character must sacrifice some part of her life energy (2 points of Constitution) one time. If the character gets the Constitution points back (such as from a restoration spell), the item ceases functioning. (The item does not cease functioning if the character receives a Constitution increase caused by level gain, a wish, or the use of a magic item.)
• Item must be cleansed with holy water each day.
• Item must be used to kill a living creature each day.
• Item must be bathed in volcanic lava once per month.
• Item must be used at least once a day, or it won’t function again for its current possessor.
• Item must draw blood when wielded (weapons only). It can’t be put away or exchanged for another weapon until it has scored a hit.
• Item must have a particular spell cast upon it each day (such as bless, atonement, or animate objects).
Requirements are so dependent upon suitability to the item that they should never be determined randomly. An item with a requirement that is also intelligent often imposes its requirement through its personality. If the requirement is not met, the item ceases to function. If it is met, usually the item functions for one day before the requirement must be met again (although some requirements are one time only, others monthly, and still others continuous).
Drawback: Items with drawbacks are usually still beneficial to the possessor but they also carry some negative aspect. Although sometimes drawbacks occur only when the item is used (or held, in the case of some items such as weapons), usually the drawback remains with the character for as long as she has the item.
Roll on the table below to generate a drawback that (unless otherwise indicated) remains in effect as long as the item is in the character’s possession.

SPECIFIC CURSED ITEMS
Specific Cursed Items are provided as examples of cursed items. They are given creation prerequisites, should someone want to intentionally create them (although that does not need to be the origin of the item). Note, however, two exceptions: The crystal hypnosis ball and the bag of devouring cannot be created by any known means.
A simple detect magic spell yields a misleading aura and strength, often indicating that the item is a noncursed item of similar sort. An identify spell only has a 1% chance per caster level to reveal a cursed item’s true properties, including the cursed aspect. Analyze dweomer reveals the true nature of a cursed item.

Amulet of Inescapable Location: This device is typically worn on a chain or as a brooch. It appears, to magical analysis, to prevent location, scrying or detection or influence by detect thoughts or telepathy. It seems to be an amulet of proof against detection and location. Actually, the amulet gives the wearer a –10 penalty on all saves against divination spells.
Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, bestow curse; Price 1,000 gp.
Armor of Arrow Attraction: Magical analysis indicates that this armor is a normal suit of +3 full plate. However, the armor is cursed. It works normally with regard to melee attacks but actually serves to attract ranged weapons. The wearer takes a –15 penalty to AC against any attack by a ranged weapon. The true nature of the armor does not reveal itself until the character is fired upon in earnest.
Strong abjuration; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bestow curse; Price 9,000 gp.
Armor of Rage: This armor is similar in appearance to armor of command and functions as a suit of +1 full plate. However, when it is worn, the armor causes the character to take a –4 penalty to Charisma. All unfriendly characters within 300 feet have a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against her. The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected. (In other words, the wearer does not immediately notice that donning the armor is the cause of her problems, nor do foes understand the reason for the depth of their enmity.)
Strong necromancy; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bestow curse; Price 1,600 gp.
Bag of Devouring: This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a bag of holding. The sack is, however, a lure used by an extradimensional creature—in fact, one of its feeding orifices.
Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to “swallowing’’ if thrust within the bag. The bag of devouring is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but any time thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending member and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on grapple checks made to pull someone in.
The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a bag of holding type I, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim’s body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.
Moderate conjuration; CL 17th; In effect, this is a creature and cannot be created; Price n/a.
Boots of Dancing: These boots initially appear and function as one of the other kinds of magic boots. But when the wearer is in (or fleeing from) melee combat, boots of dancing impede movement, making him behave as if irresistible dance had been cast upon him. Only a remove curse spell enables the wearer to be rid of the boots once their true nature is revealed.
Strong enchantment; CL 16th; Create Wondrous Item, irresistible dance; Price 30,000 gp.
Bracers of Defenselessness: These appear to be bracers of armor +5 and actually serve as such until the wearer is attacked in anger by an enemy with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than her level. At that moment and thereafter, the bracers cause a –5 penalty to AC. Once their curse is activated, bracers of defenselessness can be removed only by means of a remove curse spell.
Moderate conjuration; CL 16th; Create Wondrous Item, mage armor, bestow curse; Price 1,200 gp.
Broom of Animated Attack: This item is indistinguishable in appearance from a normal broom. It is identical to a broom of flying by all tests short of attempted use.
If a command is spoken, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground (no falling damage, since the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the victim, swatting the face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end.
The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw and two with the handle, for a total of four attacks per round). It attacks with a +5 bonus on each attack roll. The straw end causes a victim to be blinded for 1 round when it hits. The handle deals 1d6 points of damage when it hits. The broom has AC 13, 18 hit points, and hardness 4.
Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, fly, animate objects; Price 5,200 gp.
Cloak of Poisonousness: This cloak is usually made of a woolen material, although it can be made of leather. A detect poison spell can reveal the presence of poison impregnated in the cloak’s fabric. The garment can be handled without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned the wearer is killed instantly unless she succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save.
Once donned, a cloak of poisonousness can be removed only with a remove curse spell; doing this destroys the magical property of the cloak. If a neutralize poison spell is then used, it is possible to revive the victim with a raise dead or resurrection spell, but not before.
Strong abjuration; CL 15th; Create Wondrous Item, poison, and limited wish or miracle; Price 62,000 gp.
Crystal Hypnosis Ball: This cursed item is indistinguishable from a normal crystal ball. However, anyone attempting to use the scrying device becomes fascinated for 1d6 minutes, and a telepathic suggestion is implanted in his mind (Will DC 19 negates).
The user of the device believes that the desired creature or scene was viewed, but actually he came under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the crystal hypnosis ball gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a servant or a tool. Note that throughout this time, the user remains unaware of his subjugation.
Moderate divination; CL 17th; In effect, this is a minor artifact and cannot be created; Price n/a.
Dust of Sneezing and Choking: This fine dust appears to be dust of appearance. If cast into the air, it causes those within a 20- foot spread to fall into fits of sneezing and coughing. Those failing a DC 15 Fortitude save take 2d6 points of Constitution damage immediately. In addition, those failing a second DC 15 Fortitude save 1 minute later are dealt 1d6 points of Constitution damage. Those who succeed on either saving throw are nonetheless disabled by choking (treat as stunned) for 5d4 rounds.
Faint conjuration; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, poison; Price 2,400 gp.
Flask of Curses: This item looks like an ordinary beaker, bottle, container, decanter, flask, or jug. It may contain a liquid, or it may emit smoke. When the flask is first unstoppered, all within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save or be cursed, taking a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until a remove curse spell is cast upon them.
Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, bestow curse; Price 2,100 gp.
Gauntlets of Fumbling: These gauntlets may be of supple leather or heavy protective material suitable for use with armor. In the former instance, they appear to be gloves of Dexterity. In the latter case, they appear to be gauntlets of ogre power. The gauntlets perform according to every test as if they were gloves of Dexterity or gauntlets of ogre power until the wearer finds herself under attack or in a life-and-death situation. At that time, the curse is activated. The wearer becomes fumble-fingered, with a 50% chance each round of dropping anything held in either hand. The gauntlets also lower Dexterity by 2 points. Once the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of a remove curse spell, a wish, or a miracle.
Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, bestow curse; Price 1,300 gp.
Helm of Opposite Alignment: This metal hat looks like a typical helmet. When placed upon the head, however, its curse immediately takes effect (Will DC 15 negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment—good to evil, chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required. The curse only works once; that is, a character whose alignment has been changed cannot change it again by donning the helmet a second time.
Only a wish or a miracle can restore former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. (In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible.) If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an atonement spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a helm of opposite alignment has functioned once, it loses its magical properties.
Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Create Wondrous Item, creator must be 12th level; Price 4,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.
Incense of Obsession: These blocks of incense appear to be incense of meditation. If meditation and prayer are conducted while incense of obsession is burning nearby, its odor and smoke cause the user to become totally confident that her spell ability is superior, due to the magic incense. The user is determined to use her spells at every opportunity, even when not needed or when useless. The user remains obsessed with her abilities and spells until all have been used or cast, or until 24 hours have elapsed.
Moderate enchantment; CL 6th; Create Wondrous Item, bestow curse; Price 200 gp.
Mace of Blood: This +3 heavy mace must be coated in blood every day, or its bonus fades away (until the mace is coated again). The character using this mace must make a DC 13 Will save every day it is within his possession or become chaotic evil.
Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be at least 9th level and chaotic evil; Price 16,000 gp.
Medallion of Thought Projection: This device seems like a medallion of thoughts, even down to the range at which it functions, except that the thoughts overheard are muffled and distorted, requiring a DC 15 Will save to sort out. However, while the user thinks she is picking up the thoughts of others, all she is really hearing are figments created by the medallion itself. These illusory thoughts always seem plausible and thus can seriously mislead any who rely upon them. What’s worse, unknown to her, the cursed medallion actually broadcasts her thoughts to creatures in the path of the beam, thus alerting them to her presence.
Faint divination; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, ghost sound; Price 1,800 gp.
Necklace of Strangulation: A necklace of strangulation appears to be a rare and wondrous piece of valuable jewelry and, short of the use of something as powerful as a miracle or a wish, can only be identified as a cursed item when placed around a character’s neck. The necklace immediately constricts, dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of a limited wish, wish, or miracle and remains clasped around the victim’s throat even after his death. Only when he has decayed to a dry skeleton (after approximately one month) does the necklace loosen, ready for another victim.
Strong conjuration; CL 18th; Create Wondrous Item, slay living; Price 60,000 gp.
Net of Snaring: This net provides a +3 bonus on attack rolls but can only be used underwater, thus making it a somewhat useful item rather than what most would really call a cursed item. Underwater, it can be commanded to shoot forth up to 30 feet to trap a creature.
Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, freedom of movement; Price 10,000 gp.
Periapt of Foul Rotting: This engraved gem appears to be of little value. If any character keeps the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she contracts a terrible rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be removed only by application of a remove curse spell followed by a cure disease and then a heal, miracle, limited wish, or wish spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a periapt of health and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round action), whereupon the periapt of foul rotting likewise crumbles to dust.
Faint abjuration; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, contagion; Price 17,000 gp.
Potion of Poison: This potion has lost its once beneficial magical abilities and has become a potent poison. The imbiber must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d10 points of Constitution damage. A minute later he must save again (DC 16) or take 1d10 points of Constitution damage.
Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, poison; Price 5,000 gp.
Robe of Powerlessness: A robe of powerlessness appears to be a magic robe of another sort. As soon as a character dons this garment, she takes a –10 penalty to Strength and Intelligence, forgetting spells and magic knowledge accordingly. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, the character must receive a remove curse spell followed by heal.
Moderate transmutation; CL 13th; Create Wondrous Item, bestow curse, permanency; Price 5,500 gp.
Robe of Vermin: The wearer notices nothing unusual when the robe is donned, other than that it offers great magical defense (as a cloak of protection +4). However, as soon as he is in a situation requiring concentration and action against hostile opponents, the true nature of the garment is revealed: The wearer immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the insects that magically infest the garment. He must cease all other activities in order to scratch, shift the robe, and generally show signs of the extreme discomfort caused by the bites and movement of these pests.
The wearer takes a –5 penalty on initiative checks and a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks. If he tries to cast a spell, he must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell.
Moderate abjuration; CL 13th; Create Wondrous Item, summon swarm, creator must be at least 13th level; Price 16,500 gp.
Ring of Clumsiness: This ring operates exactly like a ring of feather falling. However, it also makes the wearer clumsy. She takes a –4 penalty to Dexterity and has a 20% chance of spell failure when trying to cast any arcane spell that has a somatic component. (This chance of spell failure stacks with other arcane spell failure chances.)
Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Forge Ring, feather fall, bestow curse; Price 500 gp.
Scarab of Death: This small pin appears to be any one of the various beneficial amulets, brooches, or scarabs. However, if it is held for more than 1 round or carried by a living creature for 1 minute, it changes into a horrible burrowing beetlelike creature. The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into flesh, and reaches the victim’s heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, but he still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab form. Placing the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal prevents the monster from coming to life and allows for long-term storage of the item.
Strong abjuration; CL 19th; Create Wondrous Item, slay living; Price 80,000 gp.
Spear, Cursed Backbiter: This is a +2 shortspear, but each time it is used in melee against a foe and the attack roll is a natural 1, it damages its wielder instead of her intended target. When the curse takes effect, the spear curls around to strike its wielder in the back, automatically dealing the damage to the wielder. The curse even functions when the spear is hurled, and in such a case the damage to the hurler is doubled.
Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bestow curse; Price 7,500 gp.
Stone of Weight (Loadstone): This stone appears to be a dark, smoothly polished stone. It reduces the possessor’s base land speed to one-half of normal. Once picked up, the stone cannot be disposed of by any nonmagical means—if it is thrown away or smashed, it reappears somewhere on his person. If a remove curse spell is cast upon a loadstone, the item may be discarded normally and no longer haunts the individual.
Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Create Wondrous Item, slow; Price 1,000 gp.
–2 Sword, Cursed: This longsword performs well against targets in practice, but when used against an opponent in combat, it causes its wielder to take a –2 penalty on attack rolls.
All damage dealt is also reduced by 2 points, but never below a minimum of 1 point of damage on any successful hit. After one week in a character’s possession, the sword always forces that character to employ it rather than another weapon. The sword’s owner automatically draws it and fights with it even when she meant to draw or ready some other weapon. The sword can be gotten rid of only by means of limited wish, wish, or miracle.
Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bestow curse, and limited wish or miracle; Price 1,500 gp.
Sword, Berserking: This item appears to have the characteristics of a +2 greatsword. However, whenever the sword is used in battle, its wielder goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian’s rage ability). He attacks the nearest creature and continues to fight until unconscious or dead or until no living thing remains within 30 feet. Although many see this sword as a cursed object, others see it as a boon.
Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, rage, bestow curse; Price 17,500 gp.
Vacuous Grimoire: A book of this sort looks like a normal one on some mildly interesting topic. Any character who opens the work and reads so much as a single word therein must make two DC 15 Will saves. The first is to determine if the reader takes 1 point of permanent Intelligence drain. The second is to find out if the reader takes 2 points of permanent Wisdom drain. To destroy the book, a character must burn it while casting remove curse. If the grimoire is placed with other books, its appearance instantly alters to conform to the look of those other works.
Strong enchantment; CL 20th; Create Wondrous Item, feeblemind; Price 6,000 gp.


ARTIFACTS
Artifacts are extremely powerful. Rather than merely another form of magic equipment, they are the sorts of legendary relics that whole campaigns can be based on. Each could be the center of a whole set of adventures—a quest to recover it, a fight against a opponent wielding it, a mission to cause its destruction, and so on.
No table has been included to randomly generate specific artifacts, since these items should only enter a campaign through deliberate choice on your part.

MINOR ARTIFACTS
Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are magic items that no longer can be created, at least by common mortal means.

Minor Artifact Descriptions
Described below is a selection of the most well-known (not necessarily the most numerous) minor artifacts.

Book of Infinite Spells: This work bestows upon any character of any class the ability to use the spells within its pages. However, any character not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she uses its power. A book of infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a dice roll: 01–50, arcane spell; 51–100, divine spell.
Determine the exact spell by using the tables for determining major scroll spells.
Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back—paging through a book of infinite spells is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.
Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character’s class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied into a spellbook—their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself.
The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power.
Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The owner knows this and may even benefit from the turning by gaining access to a new spell. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is.
Condition

Caster employing a spell usable by own class and level
10%
Caster employing a spell not usable by own class and level
20%
Nonspellcaster employing divine spell
25%
Nonspellcaster employing arcane spell
30%
Treat each spell use as if a scroll were being employed, for purposes of determining casting time, spell failure, and so on.
Strong (all schools); CL 18th;Weight 3 lb.

Deck of Many Things: A deck of many things (both beneficial and baneful) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.
The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never again draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. Exception: If the jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards.
Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the jester or the fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below.

Balance: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level.
Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level.
Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment— either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards.
Euryale: The medusalike visage of this card brings a curse that only the fates card or a deity can remove. The –1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent.
Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation.
Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can’t be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.
Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the jester.
Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, the gems 1,000 gp value each.
Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional.
Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the fool. The redraws are optional.
Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character’s hand.
Knight: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character.
Moon: This card sometimes bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received.
Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the character’s NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and forever after
hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.
Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost.
Skull: A dread wraith appears. Treat this creature as an unturnable undead. The character must fight it alone—if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle.
Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities.
Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated.
Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably gone.
Throne: The character becomes a true leader in people’s eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).
Vizier: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any
single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within one year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another question entirely.
The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character’s body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere—in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.
Strong (all schools); CL 20th.

Hammer of Thunderbolts: This +3 Large returning warhammer deals 4d6 points of damage on any hit. Further, if the wielder wears a belt of giant Strength and gauntlets of ogre power and he knows that the hammer is a hammer of thunderbolts (not just a +3 warhammer), the weapon can be used to full effect: It gains a total +5 enhancement bonus, allows all belt and gauntlet bonuses to stack (only when using this weapon), and strikes dead any giant upon whom it scores a hit (Fortitude DC 20 negates the death effect but not the damage).
When hurled, on a successful attack the hammer emits a great noise, like a clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates). The hammer’s range increment is 30 feet.
Strong evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; CL 20th; Weight 15 lb.

Philosopher’s Stone: This rare substance appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock. If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone’s heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any arcane spellcaster to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher’s stone can turn from up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver, or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold. However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.
The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a true resurrection spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon.
Strong transmutation; CL 20th;Weight 3 lb.

Sphere of Annihilation: A sphere of annihilation is a globe of absolute blackness, a ball of nothingness 2 feet in diameter. The object is actually a hole in the continuity of the multiverse. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.
A sphere of annihilation is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character’s ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.
Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere’s speed in a round is 10 feet +5 feet for every 5 points by which the character’s control check result in that round exceeded 30.
If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it.
If two or more creatures vie for control of a sphere of annihilation, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.
Should a gate spell be cast upon a sphere of annihilation, there is a 50% chance (01–50 on d%) that the spell destroys it, a 35% chance (51–85) that the spell does nothing, and a 15% chance (86–100) that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything within a 180-foot radius into another plane. If a rod of cancellation touches a sphere of annihilation,
they negate each other in a tremendous explosion. Everything within a 60-foot radius takes 2d6x10 points of damage. Dispel
magic and mage’s disjunction have no effect on a sphere.
See also talisman of the sphere (below).
Strong transmutation; CL 20th.

Staff of the Magi: A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions. Some of its powers use charges, while others don’t. The following powers do not use charges:
• Detect magic
• Enlarge person (Fortitude DC 15 negates)
• Hold portal
• Light
• Mage armor
• Mage hand
The following powers drain 1 charge per usage:
• Dispel magic
• Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )
• Ice storm
• Invisibility
• Knock
• Lightning bolt (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )
• Passwall
• Pyrotechnics (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates)
• Wall of fire
• Web
These powers drain 2 charges per usage:
• Monster summoning IX
• Plane shift (Will DC 21 negates)
• Telekinesis (400 lb. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates)
A staff of the magi gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. (Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.)
Retributive Strike: A staff of the magi can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 17 Reflex save reduces damage by half.
The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01–50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if she does not (51–100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her. Only specific items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power are capable of a retributive strike.
Strong (all schools); CL 20th;Weight 5 lb.

Talisman of Pure Good: A good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of an evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be good, and if he is not exceptionally pure in thought and deed the evil character gains a DC 19 Reflex saving throw to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function.
A talisman of pure good has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, he takes 6d6 points of damage. If an evil divine spellcaster touches one, he takes 8d6 points of damage. All other characters are unaffected by the device.
Strong evocation [good]; CL 18th.

Talisman of the Sphere: This small adamantine loop and handle are useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters
who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a sphere of annihilation, a talisman of the sphere doubles the character’s modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose).
If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he need check for maintaining control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a sphere of annihilation, the talisman’s power of control can be suppressed or canceled.
Strong transmutation; CL 16th;Weight 1 lb.

Talisman of Reluctant Wishes: A talisman of this sort appears the same as a stone of controlling earth elementals. Its powers are quite different, however, and dependent on the Charisma of the individual holding the talisman. Whenever a character touches a talisman of reluctant wishes, he must make a DC 15 Charisma check.
If he fails, the device acts as a stone of weight. Discarding or destroying it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.
If he succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a wish is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.
If he rolls a natural 20, the character finds it impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he has points of Charisma. In addition, the artifact grants him one wish for every 6 points of the character’s Charisma. It also grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)
Regardless of which reaction results, a talisman of reluctant wishes disappears when its time period expires, leaving behind a 10,000 gp diamond in its stead.
Strong conjuration; CL 20th;Weight 1 lb.

Talisman of Ultimate Evil: An evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of a good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be evil, and if she is not exceptionally foul and perverse in the sights of her evil deity the good character gains a DC 19 Reflex save to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function.
A talisman of ultimate evil has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, she takes 6d6 points of damage. If a good divine spellcaster touches one, she takes 8d6 points of damage. All other characters are unaffected by the device.
Strong evocation [evil]; CL 18th.

MAJOR ARTIFACTS
Major artifacts are unique items—only one of each such item exists. These are the most potent of magic items, capable of altering the balance of a campaign.
Unlike all other magic items, major artifacts are not easily destroyed. Each should have only a single, specific means of destruction.

Major Artifact Descriptions

The Moaning Diamond: The Moaning Diamond appears to be an uncut diamond the size of a human fist. At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning sound, as if in pain. Despite the noise, the Moaning Diamond is not evil. The wielder of the stone can, three times per day, call upon it to reshape earth and stone as if by the spell stone shape, affecting 5,000 cubic feet of material. The Moaning Diamond can summon an elder earth elemental with maximum hit points that serves the caster until it is slain. Only one such elemental can be summoned at a time; if it is slain, a new creature cannot be summoned for 24 hours.

The Orbs of Dragonkind: Each of these fabled orbs contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an Orb can dominate dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as dominate monster), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. (Spell resistance is not useful against this effect.) Each Orb of Dragonkind bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the Orb. A character possessing an Orb of Dragonkind is immune to the breath weapon—but only the breath weapon—of the dragon variety keyed to the Orb. Finally, a character possessing an Orb can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the Orb three times per day.
All Orbs of Dragonkind can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other Orbs. The owner of an Orb knows whether there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the Orb’s particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb’s variety, the wielder can determine the exact location and age of the creature. The bearer of one of these Orbs earns the enmity forever of all dragonkind for profiting by the enslavement of one of their kin, even if she later loses the item.
Each Orb also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at 10th caster level.
• Black Dragon Orb: Fly (Will DC 17 negates).
• Blue Dragon Orb: Haste (Fortitude DC 17 negates).
• Brass Dragon Orb: Teleport (Will DC 19 negates).
• Bronze Dragon Orb: Scrying (Will DC 18 negates).
• Copper Dragon Orb: Suggestion (Will DC 17 negates).
• Gold Dragon Orb: The owner of the gold Orb can call upon any power possessed by one of the other Orbs—including the dominate and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity—but can only use an individual
power once per day. She can use dominate on any other possessor of an Orb within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates).
• Green Dragon Orb: Spectral hand.
• Red Dragon Orb: Wall of fire.
• Silver Dragon Orb: Cure critical wounds (Will DC 18 half ).
• White Dragon Orb: Protection from energy (cold) (Fortitude DC 17 negates).

The Saint’s Mace: This relic appears to be a simple, well-used cudgel, but its simple appearance hides great power. The saint’s mace has a +5 enhancement bonus and functions as a heavy mace with the holy, lawful, and disruption special abilities. The wielder can project searing light from the mace at will, at caster level 20th.

The Shadowstaff: This artifact was crafted centuries ago, weaving together the wispy strands of shadow itself into a twisted black staff. The Shadowstaff makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks.
The Shadowstaff also has these powers.
• Summon Shadows: Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a summon monster V spell cast at 20th level.
• Summon Nightshade: Once per month, the staff can summon a nightcrawler nightshade that serves the wielder as if called by a summon monster IX spell cast at 20th level.
• Shadow Form: Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by the
gaseous form spell.
• Shadow Bolt: Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.

The Shield of the Sun: This +5 large shield, emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin with a Wisdom score of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day that the character might have, even if she’s already a paladin. The Shield of the Sun also grants spell resistance 15 to its wielder. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield’s owner must undertake a quest (no saving throw to avoid) at the behest of a lawful good deity.
A character who is evil or chaotic (LE, NE, CE, CN, CG) gains four negative levels if she attempts to use this artifact. Although these negative levels never results in actual level loss, they remain as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer’s possession.

Psionic Items
-------------

PSIONIC ITEMS

USING ITEMS
To use a psionic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation is accomplished simply by picking up an item or putting it on. Some items, once they are carried or worn, function constantly. In most cases, using an item requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, power completion items (see below) are treated just like powers in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.
Activating a psionic item is a standard action unless the item description indicates otherwise. The manifesting time of a power is the time required to activate the same power in an item, whether it’s a power stone, a dorje, or a psionic tattoo, unless the item description specifically states otherwise.
The four ways to activate psionic items are described below.
Power Completion: This is the activation method for power stones. A power stone holds a power that is mostly finished. All that’s left to do is perform the short, simple, finishing parts of the manifestation (the final mental coda, as it were). To use a power completion item safely, a character must be of high enough level in the appropriate class to manifest the power already. If he can’t already manifest the power, there’s a chance he’ll make a mistake (see Brainburn in the power stone description). Activating a power completion item is a standard action and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as manifesting a power does.
Powers stored in power completion items are usually not augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to be the minimum necessary to manifest the stored power. However, an item’s description may specify otherwise (some power stones have manifester levels higher than the minimum required to manifest the stored power, and are then assumed to be augmented as well).
Power Trigger: This is the activation method for dorjes and psicrowns. It requires the special knowledge of power manifestation that a character of the appropriate class would know, and the formation of the appropriate command thought. If a power is on a character’s power list, the character knows how to use a power trigger item that stores that power. The user must still determine what power is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating a power trigger item is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Powers stored in power trigger items are not augmented. Such powers are assumed to be stored in the item at the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. However, certain items may specify a higher manifester level than necessary. If such an item holds a power that deals hit point damage, the power is assumed to be augmented to the maximum allowed by the power and the manifester level.
Command Thought: If no activation method is suggested either in the psionic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command thought is needed to activate it. Command thought activation means that a character mentally projects a thought, and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed. Activating a command thought psionic item is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Sometimes the command thought to activate an item is mentally imprinted within it and is whispered into the mind of a creature who picks it up. Other items are silent, but a Knowledge (psionics) or Knowledge (history) check might be useful in helping to identify command thoughts. A successful DC 30 check is needed to come up with the command thought in this case. The power psionic identify reveals command thoughts.
Powers stored in command thought items are usually not augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.
Use-Activated: This type of psionic item simply has to be used to activate. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.
Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Some items made for wearing must still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command thought (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen  (a free action). The description of an item states whether a command thought is needed in such a case.
Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated psionic item is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes attacks of opportunity in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a psionic effect occurs, then use activation is a standard action. If the item’s activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time, use activation is not an action at all.
Use activation doesn’t mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes automatically.
Powers stored in use-activated items are usually not augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.

SAVING THROWS AGAINST PSIONIC ITEM POWERS
Psionic items produce psionic powers. The DC of a saving throw against a power from a psionic item is always 10 + the level of the power or effect + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to manifest that level of power.
Another way to figure the same number is to multiply the power’s level by 1-1/2 and add 10 to the result.
Psicrowns are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw as if the wielder manifested the power, including caster level and all modifiers to save DC.
Some psionic items take advantage of the fact that powers can be augmented to increase their saving throw DCs. These items are special and have their cost to create and market price calculated using the manifester’s level instead of the power’s level.
Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact power equivalent (making its level otherwise difficult to quickly determine).

DAMAGING PSIONIC ITEMS
A psionic item doesn’t need to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his saving throw. Psionic items should always get a save against powers or spells that might deal damage to them—even against attacks from which a mundane item would normally get no chance to save. All types of psionic item saves—Fortitude, Reflex, and Will—are calculated the same way: The item’s saving throw bonus equals 2 + 1/2 its manifester level (round down). The only exceptions to this rule are intelligent psionic items, which make Will saves based on their own Wisdom scores.
A psionic item, unless otherwise noted, takes damage as a normal item of the same type. A damaged psionic item continues to function, but if it is destroyed, all its psionic power is lost.

REPAIRING ITEMS
Some psionic items (especially psionic weapons and shields) may take damage over the course of an adventure. It costs no more to repair a psionic item with the Craft skill than it does to repair its nonpsionic counterpart. The make whole spell can repair a damaged—but not completely broken— psionic item.

INTELLIGENT ITEMS
Some psionic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all their own. Only permanent psionic items (as opposed to those that are single-use items, those that have charges, or those that store power points) can be intelligent. (This means that psionic tattoos, power stones, and dorjes, among other items, are never intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of psionic items have intelligence.

CURSED ITEMS
Some psionic items are cursed—incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces. Cursed items might be particularly dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor f law, an inconvenient requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are cursed 5% of the time.

CHARGES AND MULTIPLE USES
Some items are limited in power by the number of charges they hold or the number of power points they contain. Normally, charged items (such as dorjes) have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges left (round down, minimum 1).
Similarly, items that contain power points (such as psicrowns) have a number of points equal to 50 x the manifester level of the creator. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number by which the manifester level is multiplied (round down, minimum 1).
Market prices given on the tables are always for fully charged or fully powered items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged or fully powered.) For an item that’s worthless when its charges or power points run out (which is the case for almost all charged or powered items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its charges, only part of the item’s value is based on the number of charges left.
Some items are single-use and expendable. Such items can often be found in sets or groups.

PSIONIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS
In the following sections, each type of psionic item, such as armor or psionic tattoos, has a general description, followed by descriptions of specific items.
General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other information. The Armor Class, hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some types of psionic items. The Armor Class assumes that the item is unattended and includes a –5 penalty for the item’s effective Dexterity of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the creature’s Dexterity modifier as an adjustment to Armor Class in place of the –5 penalty.
Some individual items, notably those that simply store psionic powers, don’t get full-blown descriptions. Simply reference the power’s description. Assume that the power is manifested at the minimum level required to manifest it, unless otherwise noted. Increasing the manifester level so increases the cost of the item; see Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Value, substituting “spell” for “power” and “caster level” for “manifester level” as appropriate. The main reason to make the manifester level higher, or course, would be to increase the potency of the power. Raising the manifester level is common for powers such as astral construct, the duration of which increases with the level of the manifester.
Items with full descriptions have their abilities detailed, and each of the following aspects of these items is summarized at the end of the description.
Aura: Most of the time, a detect psionics power will reveal the discipline associated with a psionic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item’s notational entry in the form of a phrase. See the detect psionics power description for more information.
Manifester Level: The next entry in the summary indicates the level of the creator (or the manifester level of the powers placed within the item, if this level is lower than the actual level of the creator). The manifester level provides the item’s saving throw bonus, as well as range and other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable).
It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a dispel psionics power or a similar situation. This information is given in the form “ML x,” where “ML” is an abbreviation for manifester
level and “x” is an ordinal number representing the manifester level itself.
For psionic tattoos, power stones, and dorjes, the creator can set the manifester level of an item at any number high enough to manifest the stored power and not higher than her own manifester level. For other psionic items, the item itself determines the manifester level. In this case, the creator’s manifester level must be as high as the item’s manifester level (and prerequisites may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator’s level).
Prerequisites: Certain requirements must be met in order for a character to create a psionic item. These include feats, powers, and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and race or kind. The prerequisites for creation of an item are given in the summary immediately following the item’s manifester level.
A power prerequisite can be provided by a character who knows the power, or through the use of a power completion or power trigger psionic item or a psi-like ability that produces the desired power effect. For each day that passes during the creation process, the creator must expend one power completion item (such as a power stone) or 1 charge from a power trigger item (such as a dorje), if either of those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.
It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary, such as if one character knows some of the powers necessary to create an item and another character knows the rest.
If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator’s level must be known. (It’s sensible, although not mandatory, for the highest-level character involved to be considered the creator.) The character designated as the creator pays the experience points required to make the item.
Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one or more powers (or some other requirement in addition to the feat). When two powers at the end of a list are separated by “or,” one of those powers is required in addition to every other power mentioned prior to the last two.
Market Price: This gold piece value, given in the summary following the word “Price,” represents the price someone should expect to pay to buy the item. Market prices are also included on the random generation tables for easy reference. The market price of an item that can be constructed with a psionic item creation feat is usually equal to the base price + the price for any components (special materials or experience point expenditure).
Cost to Create: The cost in gold pieces and experience points to create the item is given in the summary following the word “Cost.” This information appears only for items with components (material or experience points) that make their market prices higher than their base prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the cost of the components. Items without components do not have a “Cost” entry. For them, the market price and base price are the same. The cost in gold pieces is 1/2 the market price, and the cost in experience points is 1/25 the market price.
Weight: The notational entry for many items ends with a value for the item’s weight. When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for the purpose of determining how much of a load a character can carry).

ARMOR AND SHIELDS
In general, psionic armor and shields follow the rules for the equivalent magic items, as far as enhancement bonuses, stacking, and other base abilities are concerned. An enhancement bonus is treated the same way regardless of whether magic or psionics created it.
Psionic armor and shields differ from standard and magical equivalents in that psionic armor and shields incorporate one or more crystals into their construction. Particularly powerful armor and shields may be entirely composed of brightly hued or transparent crystals.
Special Qualities: Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the item is intelligent, an 02–31 result indicates that the command thought (if any) is psionically imprinted and whispers itself into the user’s mind on acquisition, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities.
Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes also extraordinary powers and special purposes. Substitute manifesting for spellcasting as required.

Psionic Armor and Shield Special Ability Descriptions
Most psionic armor and shields have only enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
Aporter: As a standard action, a suit of aporter armor or an aporter shield transports the wearer and her equipment to any spot within 800 feet that she can visualize or specify, as the psionic dimension door power. The armor or shield can transport the wearer in this fashion twice per day.
Moderate psychoportation; ML 10th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, psionic dimension door; Price +40,320 gp.
Averter: On command, up to three times per day, any creature to whom the wearer presents an averter shield must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be overcome by a powerful aversion to the wielder (actually the shield), and will not approach within 30 feet. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect, as the aversion power.
Faint telepathy; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, aversion; Price +12,960 gp.
Ectoplasmic: As a standard action, ectoplasmic armor converts itself, its wearer, and all the wearer’s equipment into ectoplasmic form for up to 5 minutes once per day, as the power of the same name. In this semisolid state, the wearer gains damage reduction 10/psionics.
Faint psychometabolism; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, ectoplasmic form; Price +10,800 gp.
Floating: This kind of armor is psionically buoyant in water or a similar liquid, negating the normal penalty for wearing armor when making Swim checks. Additionally, it grants a +4 circumstance bonus on Swim checks.
Faint psychoportation; ML 4th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, float; Price +4,000 gp.
Gleaming: This kind of armor is usually made of crystal, though it doesn’t have to be. Gleams and flashes from the armor give the wearer and his armor a “fuzzy” appearance, granting the wearer concealment.
Faint metacreativity; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, concealing amorpha; Price +3 bonus.
Heartening: This kind of shield grants the wearer up to 5 temporary hit points per day on command. These temporary hit points fade after 4 minutes. The wearer can activate this power as an immediate action at any time.
Faint psychometabolism; ML 4th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, vigor; Price +720 gp.
Landing: A suit of armor with this capability allows the wearer to ignore any damage dealt by the first 60 feet of a fall. Regardless of the height of a fall, the wearer always lands on her feet.
Faint psychoportation; ML 4th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, catfall; Price +4,000 gp.
Linked: This kind of armor or shield allows the wearer to form a telepathic bond with other wearers of linked armor or shields within 10 miles. This ability is otherwise similar to the mindlink power.
Moderate telepathy; ML 6th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, mindlink; Price +6,000 gp.
Manifester: This kind of shield generates 3 power points once per day that the wearer can use when manifesting a power he knows. These power points must all be used on the same power. As usual, a psionic character cannot pay a power’s cost with power points from more than one source, so the power points in the shield must be used for discrete manifestations.
Moderate clairsentience; ML 6th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, knowledge of any 2nd-level power; Price +10,800 gp.
Mindarmor: This kind of armor or shield grants the wearer a +3 insight bonus on Will saving throws to resist all mind-affecting and/or compulsion powers.
Faint psychokinesis; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, empty mind; Price +24,000 gp.
Phasing: The wearer of this kind of armor can move through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The wearer can call on this special ability as a standard action. When the phasing ability is active, the wearer can pass through a wall or some other kind of appropriate object for a total distance of 60 feet per day (see below), breaking this distance up into several smaller passages or one long one, as desired. A wearer who exceeds this daily distance limit while inside solid material is ejected from the material at the point of entry, ending up prone in front of the now impassable barrier.
Phasing through a wall that separates two adjacent squares on the grid counts as 5 feet of distance. Phasing through a wall or barrier of any greater thickness counts as a distance equal to the barrier’s thickness plus 5 feet.
feet of distance.
Strong psychoportation; ML 13th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, psionic phase door; Price +65,520 gp.
Power Resistance: This kind of armor or shield grants the wearer power resistance while it is worn. The power resistance can be 13, 15, 17, or 19, depending on the amount that was built into the armor or shield.
Moderate clairsentience; ML 9th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, power resistance; Price +2 bonus (PR 13); +3 bonus (PR 15); +4 bonus (PR 17); or +5 bonus (PR 19).
Quickness: This kind of armor increases the wearer’s speed by 5 feet. Thus, a character whose normal speed in armor is 20 feet moves 25 feet in armor of quickness.
Faint psychoportation; ML 4th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, burst; Price +1 bonus.
Radiant: The wearer of this kind of armor gains resistance 10 against energy attacks (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The armor absorbs the first 10 points of damage dealt by any such attack, and this absorption causes it to radiate light for a number of rounds equal to the points of damage absorbed. This light is sufficient to illuminate a 60-foot-radius area.
If the armor absorbs more damage while it is radiating light, the newer radiant effect overlaps (does not stack with) the effect that was already in place.
Moderate psychokinesis; ML 9th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor; energy adaptation; Price +4 bonus.
Ranged: The wielder of a ranged shield can throw it in combat, with a range increment of 30 feet. While in the air, the shield is treated in all ways as a ranged weapon and cannot be blocked or grabbed except by those with appropriate feats. No matter the size of the wielder, a buckler or light shield deals 1d6 points of damage and a heavy one 1d8 points. (A tower shield cannot be created with this special ability.) The wielder’s Strength modifier and the shield’s enhancement bonus add to the base damage.
A ranged shield flies through the air back to the creature that threw it. It returns to the wielder just before the creature’s next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn).
Catching a ranged shield when it comes back is a free action. If the wielder can’t catch it, or if the wielder has moved since throwing it, the shield drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.
Faint psychokinesis; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, far hand; Price +1 bonus.
Seeing: This kind of armor grants a wider than normal field of vision, so that opponents flanking the wearer gain only a +1 bonus on their attack rolls instead of +2 (rogues still get their full sneak attack damage because the wearer is still flanked). The wearer gains a +1 enhancement bonus on Spot checks but takes a –2 penalty on saves against gaze attacks.
Faint clairsentience; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, ubiquitous vision; Price +6,000 gp.
Time Buttress: This kind of shield gives the wielder a chance to avoid telling blows by using time itself as a shield. Once per day, the wielder can use timeless body as though manifesting the power.
Strong psychoportation; ML 17th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, timeless body; Price +5 bonus.
Vanishing: On command, this suit of armor or shield renders its wearer and all the wearer’s equipment invisible to the minds of others, as if he had manifested the power cloud mind. The wearer can use this ability twice per day.
Faint psychokinesis; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, cloud mind; Price +3 bonus.
Wall: As a standard action once per day, the wielder can drop this kind of shield at his feet and command a wall of ectoplasm (as the power) to come into being, with the shield as the point of origin for the effect. This effect forms a wall whose area is up to twelve 10-foot squares or a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 12 feet. The wall dissipates after 7 minutes, or sooner if the wielder of the shield reclaims it (thus dismissing the effect).
Strong metacreativity; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, wall of ectoplasm; Price +20,160 gp.

WEAPONS
Although they generally follow the rules for magic weapons, psionic weapons differ from mundane and magic weapons in their design. Most possess some crystal components, and some are composed entirely of crystal. Many also sport intricate traceries along the blade or haft, which flicker now and then as if channeling flows of psychic energy.
Psionic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses on both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. This enhancement bonus is effective for the purpose of overcoming creatures with damage resistance that is penetrated by magic. All psionic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonus on attack rolls does not stack with their enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonus applies to either type of attack.
In addition to enhancement bonuses, psionic weapons can also have the special abilities detailed here. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
The rules for manifester level for weapons (called caster level), additional damage dice, ranged weapons and ammunition, ammunition and breakage, hardness and hit points, critical hits, and weapons for unusually sized creatures for psionic weapons are the same as for magic weapons. Psionic weapons do not have the chance to generate light (though some may be mentally audible; see below).
Mentally Audible: Fully 30% of psionic weapons telepathically mutter, croon, recite battle poems, scream, or produce other mental “noises” when first drawn, at first blood, or when they slay a significant enemy. Such a weapon cannot be concealed from creatures within 15 feet when it is drawn, nor can its mental “soundtrack” be curbed.
Activation: Usually a character benefits from a psionic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon—by attacking with it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to project a command thought (a standard action).

Psionic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions
Most psionic weapons have only enhancement bonuses. They can also have the special abilities detailed here. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
Bodyfeeder: All feeder weapons have a special ability that functions only upon scoring a successful critical hit. A bodyfeeder weapon grants its wielder temporary hit points equal to the total damage dealt by a successful critical hit. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes. Thus, if the wielder of a bodyfeeder weapon successfully scores a critical hit while the wielder still enjoys temporary hit points from a previous critical hit, the wielder gains only the better of the two values: either his current number of temporary hit points, or the new influx of temporary hit points, whichever is higher.
Strong psychometabolism; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, claws of the vampire; Price +3 bonus.
Collision: Collision weapons psionically increase their own mass at the end point of each swing or shot. Such weapons deal an extra 5 points of damage on each successful strike, in addition to the weapon’s enhancement bonus. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow the extra damage upon their ammunition.
Moderate metacreativity; ML 10th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, matter manipulation; Price +2 bonus.
Coup de Grace: Coup de grace weapons are exceptionally dangerous. On a successful critical hit, the foe must succeed on a DC 27 Will save or be paralyzed for 1 round. While this ability does work on creatures that are immune to extra damage from critical hits, it does not work on creatures without an Intelligence score. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability on their ammunition.
Strong telepathy; ML 19th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, psionic dominate; Price +5 bonus.
Dislocator: The wielder of this kind of weapon can attempt to dislocate a designated foe up to three times per day. On a successful hit, the foe must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be teleported 1–100 miles in a random direction. If the weapon misses, the use is wasted. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability on their ammunition.
Strong psychoportation; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, psionic teleport; Price +3 bonus.
Dissipater: This kind of weapon is devastating to creatures and objects composed of or originally formed from ectoplasm (such as astral constructs, walls of ectoplasm, creatures in ectoplasmic form, and items created using the metacreativity discipline). Against qualifying targets, a dissipater weapon ignores damage reduction and hardness, and treats all successful hits as critical hits.
Strong metacreativity; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, dismiss ectoplasm; Price +1 bonus.
Great Dislocator: The wielder of this kind of weapon can attempt to greatly dislocate a designated foe up to three times per day. On a successful hit, the foe must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be cast into a random alternate plane of existence. If the weapon misses, the use is wasted. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability upon their ammunition.
Strong psychoportation; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, psionic plane shift; Price +4 bonus.
Lucky: A lucky weapon offers a second chance at success. Once per day, the wielder can reroll a failed attack roll (whether a single attack or one in a series of multiple attacks) as a free action. The rerolled attack uses the same bonuses or penalties as the missed roll.
Moderate clairsentience; ML 8th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, fate of one; Price +1 bonus.
Manifester: This kind of weapon generates 5 power points once per day that the wearer can use when manifesting a power he knows. These power points must all be used on the same power. As usual, a psionic character cannot pay a power’s cost with power points from more than one source, so the power points in the shield must be used for discrete manifestations.
Moderate clairsentience; ML 8th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, knowledge of any 3rd-level power; Price +16,000 gp.
Mindcrusher: Any psionic creature struck in combat by a mindcrusher weapon loses a number of power points equal to half the amount of hit point damage the weapon deals (only the base damage of the weapon contributes to the power point loss; additional damage from high Strength or other sources does not cause additional power point loss). A psionic creature that is out of power points (or has none) must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or take 1d2 points of Wisdom damage.
Strong psychometabolism; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, psychic vampire; Price +2 bonus.
Mindfeeder: All feeder weapons have a special ability that functions only upon scoring a successful critical hit. A mindfeeder weapon grants its wielder temporary power points equal to the total damage dealt by a successful critical hit. These temporary power points last for 10 minutes. The wielder gains power points even if the target has none (effectively, its hit point damage is converted to power points). Constructs and undead are not subject to mindfeeder weapons. As with temporary hit points, temporary power points do not stack with each other; they overlap. Thus, if a mindfeeder weapon successfully scores a critical hit while the wielder still enjoys temporary power points from a previous critical hit, the wielder gains only the better of the two values: either her current number of temporary power points, or the new influx of temporary power points, whichever is higher.
Strong psychometabolism; ML 15th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, psychic vampire; Price +3 bonus.
Parrying: A parrying weapon perceives an instant into the future, and of its own accord resists melee and ranged attacks aimed at the wielder, granting a +1 insight bonus to the wielder’s Armor Class. The weapon is so adept at parrying that it even affects incoming powers, granting the wielder a +1 insight bonus on saving throws. The bonuses are granted whenever the wielder holds the weapon, even if flat-footed.
Faint clairsentience; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, defensive precognition; Price +8,000 gp.
Power Storing: A power storing weapon allows a manifester to store a single targeted power of up to 5 power points in the weapon. (The power must have a manifesting time of 1 standard action.) Any time the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately manifest the power on that creature as a swift action if the wielder desires. (This ability is an exception to the rule that manifesting a power from an item takes at least as long as manifesting that power normally.) Once the power is manifested, the weapon is empty, and a manifester can imbed any other targeted power of up to 5 power points into it. The weapon telepathically whispers to the wearer the name of the power currently stored within it. A randomly generated power storing weapon has a 50% chance to have a power stored in it already.
Strong psychokinesis; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, creator must be a manifester of at least 12th level; Price +1 bonus.
Psibane: A psibane weapon is crafted to oppose psionic beings. When used against such creatures, its effective enhancement bonus is 2 higher than its actual enhancement bonus. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against psionic opponents. It bestows one negative level on any psionic creature attempting to wield it. This negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way while the weapon is wielded. Psibane bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability upon their ammunition.
Strong clairsentience; ML 15th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, bend reality; Price +2 bonus.
Psychic: A psychic weapon’s power depends on its wielder. In the hands of a nonpsionic creature, the weapon possesses the qualities of a nonmagical, nonpsionic masterwork weapon. When wielded by a psionic creature, this weapon has an enhancement bonus based on the wielder’s current power point reserve, as shown on the following table. The weapon’s enhancement bonus decreases as the wielder spends power points, and it increases whenever the wielder gains enough power points (by any means) to put his power point reserve into the next higher category.

Psychokinetic: Upon command, a psychokinetic weapon glows from the inside with lethal psionic energy. The energy does not harm the hands that hold the weapon. Such a weapon deals an extra 1d4 points of damage on a successful hit. This extra damage is ectoplasmic in nature and is not affected by damage reduction. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability upon their ammunition.
Moderate psychokinesis; ML 10th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, concussion blast; Price +1 bonus.
Psychokinetic Burst: This weapon functions as a psychokinetic weapon that also releases a blast of destructive psionic energy upon scoring a successful critical hit. In addition to the extra damage of the psychokinetic ability (see above), a psychokinetic burst weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add 2d6 points of extra damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add 3d6 points of extra damage. This extra damage is ectoplasmic in nature and is not affected by damage reduction. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability upon their ammunition.
Strong psychokinesis; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, concussion blast; Price +2 bonus.
Soulbreaker: This weapon has a special ability that functions only upon scoring a successful critical hit. On a successful critical hit, a soulbreaker weapon bestows one negative level on the foe. One day after being struck, if the negative levels have not been purged, the subject must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose a character level.
Strong telepathy; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, mindwipe; Price +3 bonus.
Sundering: This kind of weapon allows a wielder to attack opponents’ weapons as if he had the Improved Sunder feat.
Faint metacreativity; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, Great Sunder, metaphysical weapon; Price +1 bonus.
Suppression: An opponent or object struck by this kind of weapon is subject to a targeted dispel psionics power. The wielder makes a power check (1d20 + 5 + manifester level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the manifester level of the power to be dispelled. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability upon their ammunition, but can do so only three times per day.
Moderate psychokinesis ML 10th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, dispel psionics; Price +2 bonus.
Teleporting: This ability can be imbedded only in weapons that can be thrown. A teleporting weapon returns through the Astral Plane to the creature that threw it. It teleports into the throwing creature’s empty hand in the round following the round when it was thrown, just before that creature’s turn. It is therefore ready to use again on that turn.
Faint psychoportation; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, psionic dimension door; Price +1 bonus.

COGNIZANCE CRYSTALS
Cognizance crystals store power points that psionic characters can use to pay for manifesting their powers.
Physical Description: A cognizance crystal consists of a core crystal and two or three smaller crystals arranged in specific positions around it on strands of silver wire. The crystals give off a faint glow. A typical cognizance crystal weighs approximately 1 pound, has AC 7, 10 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 16.
Activation: The user must merely hold or have a crystal on her person for a period of at least 10 minutes (which is long enough to attune oneself to the crystal). Thereafter, the owner can use power points stored in the crystal to manifest powers she knows.
The maximum number of points a cognizance crystal can store is always an odd number and is never more than 17. It can store only as many power points as its original maximum, set at the time of its creation. When a cognizance crystal’s power points are used up, the glow of the crystal dims. However, the user can recharge it by paying power points on a 1-for-1 basis. While doing this depletes the user’s own power point reserve for the day, those power points remain available in the cognizance crystal until used.
A user cannot directly replenish her personal power points from those stored in a cognizance crystal, nor can she draw power points from more than one source to manifest a power. See Using Stored Power Points for more information.

DORJES
A dorje is a slender crystal that contains a single power. Each dorje has 50 charges when created, and each charge expended allows one use of that power. A dorje that runs out of charges is just a simple crystal.
Physical Description: A typical dorje is an elongated crystal of one color (or colorless), between 8 inches and 10 inches long and about 1/2 inch thick, which can weigh up to 1/4 pound. Occasionally, a dorje is decorated with carvings or inscribed runes along a face of the crystal. A typical dorje has AC 7, 7 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 18.
Activation: Dorjes use the power trigger activation method, so manifesting a power from a dorje is usually a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the power being manifested has a manifesting time longer than 1 standard action, however, it takes that long to manifest the power from a dorje.) The user must have the power on his class list, even if he knows the command thought. Additionally, to activate a dorje, a character must hold it in hand and point it in the general direction of the target or area to be affected.
Dorjes are normally created at the minimum manifester level required to manifest the power, and powers that can be augmented are not augmented when stored in a dorje. A dorje’s wielder cannot augment the power contained within the dorje. However, dorjes can be created at a higher manifester level than required to manifest the power. In this case, the dorje that holds an augmentable power is augmented, to the limit of the manifester level and the power’s augmentation maximums, if any. The manifester level of a dorje cannot be more than five higher than the minimum manifester level to use the power it contains.

POWER STONES
A power stone stores a power (or collection of powers). A stored power can be used only once, “flushing” the stone. Using a power stone is basically like manifesting a power.
Physical Description: A power stone is a thumb-sized chunk of crystal that possesses a barely detectable interior glow if it holds a low-level power. A stone imprinted with more than one power or a higher-level power glows more brightly, but never enough to provide illumination in its own right. A typical power stone has AC 7, 5 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.
Activation: To activate a power stone, a manifester must mentally address it, as described below. Once the power is known, the power stone is treated as a power completion item, except as noted below.
Addressing the Stone: A power stone must be “addressed” before a character can use it or know exactly what power it contains. Doing this requires a successful Psicraft check (DC 15 + power level). Once a particular power stone has been addressed, it is not necessary to do so again. Addressing a power stone in advance lets a character proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use it.
Using a stone’s stored power after addressing the stone requires holding the stone and willing the power’s manifestation, as if manifesting a power normally (a standard action). Activating a power stone is subject to disruption just as manifesting a power normally would be.
Additionally, the user must meet the following requirements.
• The user must have the power on his or her class list.
• The user must have the requisite key ability score.
If the user meets these requirements and has a manifester level at least equal to the power’s manifester level, she can automatically manifest the stored power without a check. If she meets both requirements but her own level is lower than the power stone’s manifester level, she has to make a manifester level check (1d20 + user’s level), against a DC equal to the power stone’s manifester level +1, to manifest the power successfully. On a failure, the user must succeed on a DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid brainburn (see below). A natural roll of 1 on this check is always a failure.
Determine Effect: A power successfully manifested from a power stone works exactly as if manifested normally. Assume the power stone’s manifester level is always the minimum level required to manifest the power for the character who imprinted the stone, unless the creator specifically desires otherwise.
A power stone’s glow fades when its stored power is flushed.
Brainburn: When something goes awry, the user of a power stone improperly manifests the stored power. The resultant psionic surge persists for 1d4 rounds, unless the power stone is flung farther than 100 feet away or is destroyed. This surge deals 1d6 points of damage per power stored per round and arcs across multiple targets, similar to energy current, except the damage type isn’t specified. The user is the primary target, and one nearby ally is the secondary target (chosen at random).
The manifester level for a standard power stone is the minimum manifester level needed to manifest the power (unless otherwise specified).

PSICROWNS
A psicrown is a special headband that stores several powers. Unlike dorjes, which can contain a wide variety of powers, each psicrown is of a certain kind and holds specific powers. Unless otherwise stated, a psicrown has power points equal to 50 x its manifester level when created. These power points can be spent only on the powers that are contained in the psicrown.
Physical Description: A typical psicrown is large enough to fit on the head of a Medium creature. Some psicrowns are actually crownlike and heavily adorned, while others are simple headbands with crystal centerpieces. All psicrowns weigh less than 1 pound. Most psicrowns are metallic, but one could potentially be composed of any material. Metallic psicrowns have AC 10, 10 hit points, hardness 8, and a break DC of 28. Psicrowns made of psionically reinforced silk have AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 2, and a break DC of 24. Psicrowns can be made from other, more exotic materials, but all have at least the strength and durability of psicrowns made of psionically reinforced silk.
Activation: Psicrowns use the power trigger activation method, so manifesting a power from a psicrown is usually a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the power being manifested, however, has a longer manifesting time than 1 standard action, it takes that long to manifest the power from a psicrown.) When activating a psicrown, the user spends power points contained in the psicrown on any one of the psicrown’s powers. Powers activated from a psicrown can be augmented with additional power points from the psicrown itself, so long as the total number of power points spent does not exceed the user’s manifester level. The user can’t manifest a power from a psicrown using his own power points.

Psicrown Descriptions
Psicrowns have immense utility because they pack so many capabilities into one item and because they use the wearer’s ability score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their powers.
Unlike with other sorts of psionic items, the wearer can use his manifester level when activating the power of a psicrown if it’s higher than the manifester level of the psicrown.
The minimum manifester level of a psicrown is 8th. The manifester level of a psicrown cannot be more than five levels higher than the minimum manifester level for the highest-level power in the psicrown. Standard psicrowns are described below.

PSIONIC TATTOOS
Psionic tattoos are designs scribed on the skin that manifest powers on their wearers. The wearer doesn’t get to make any decisions about the tattoo’s effect—the manifester who scribed it has already done so.
Psionic tattoos can vary in size, but a creature can wear only a total of twenty tattoos at one time—attempting to add one more than this maximum causes all previously scribed tattoos to simultaneously activate. A psionic tattoo fades away after use.
Physical Description: A typical psionic tattoo is a colorful pattern of tiny, interlacing lines within a larger design. This design can be as simple as a circle or a star, or as complex as an artist wishes to make it. Once it is scribed, a tattoo’s design does not change. A psionic tattoo usually covers an area of skin no more than 5 inches in diameter (larger ones could be designed, but would have no added effect).
Scribing and Transferring Tattoos: The manifester level of a psionic tattoo is the minimum level required to manifest the scribed power. A psionic tattoo can contain only powers of 3rd level or lower.
A psionic tattoo inscribed on a wearer is potentially more mobile than a mundane tattoo. As a standard action, the wearer can will the tattoo to move to a different part of his body or onto the skin of any willing (or unconscious) living creature he touches. If the wearer of a psionic tattoo is rendered unconscious or is slain, another sentient creature can touch the tattoo while willing it to leave the previous wearer and apply itself to the new creature as a standard action. Psionic tattoos cannot overlay one another.
Identifying Psionic Tattoos: In addition to the standard methods of identification, the wearer of a tattoo can concentrate on it and attempt to gain some sense of how it would feel if activated. A successful DC 13 Intelligence check provides a hint to the tattoo’s effect.
Activation: A psionic tattoo produces its effect when touched by its wearer and willed to do so. This activity, called “tapping” the tattoo, is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A psionic tattoo fades away after use.
The following rules govern the use of psionic tattoos.
• A creature must have an appropriate physical surface on which to scribe the pattern (thus, incorporeal creatures or creatures with impermanent flesh, such as fire elementals, cannot use psionic tattoos).
• Tapping a psionic tattoo provokes attacks of opportunity. A successful attack (including grappling attacks) against the wearer forces a Concentration check. A wearer who fails this check cannot concentrate effectively on the tattoo to use it. The tattoo remains untapped, and the wearer can make another attempt.
• A character can trigger the effects of another’s psionic tattoo if the other wearer is unconscious. It is a full-round action to find, touch, and concentrate on an unconscious creature’s tattoo in order to tap it.
The manifester level for a standard psionic tattoo is the minimum manifester level needed to manifest the power (unless otherwise specified).

Universal Item Descriptions
Universal items can be configured to do just about anything.
Standard universal items are described below.
Amulet of Catapsi: This copper amulet aids the wearer against other psionic characters. Once per day, the wearer can mentally command the catapsi power, which blankets a 30- foot-radius area surrounding the wearer in telepathic noise for 9 rounds. Each time other psionic characters within this range attempt to manifest a power, they must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or pay 4 more points than they otherwise would for each power manifestation. The limit on the number of power points a subject can spend on a power remains in effect, so the subject may not be able to manifest his or her highest-level powers.
Moderate telepathy; ML 9th; Craft Universal Item, catapsi; Price 16,200 gp.
Boots of Landing: These boots allow the wearer to recover instantly from a fall and can absorb some damage from falling once per day. The wearer lands on her feet no matter how far she falls, and takes 2 fewer dice of damage from the fall than normal.
Faint psychoportation; ML 2nd; Craft Universal Item, catfall; Price 1,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Boots of Skating: These boots allow the wearer to slide along the ground at will as if using the skate power.
Faint psychoportation; ML 1st; Craft Universal Item, skate; Price 7,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Boots of Stomping: These boots allow the wearer to use stomp as the power three times per day (Reflex save DC 13) when the wearer stomps her feet.
Faint psychokinesis; ML 3rd; Craft Universal Item, stomp; Price 600 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Boots of Temporal Acceleration: These boots allow the wearer to speed up his own time frame for 2 rounds as if using the power temporal acceleration. The wearer can use this power once per day.
Strong psychoportation; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, temporal acceleration; Price 43,200 gp; Weight 1 lb.
Crawling Tattoos: Crawling tattoos resemble standard psionic tattoos, but their effects are often harmful rather than beneficial. Like a psionic tattoo, a crawling tattoo can be scribed only with a power of no higher than 3rd level that targets one or more creatures. Exceptions are the body adjustment power, which can be scribed even though it affects only the manifester, and telepathy (compulsion) powers, which cannot be scribed at all. Powers that normally have an area affect only one target if scribed in a crawling tattoo. Powers with an experience point requirement cannot be scribed into a crawling tattoo. Otherwise, crawling tattoos are treated as psionic tattoos until they are activated by the wearer.
The wearer of a crawling tattoo can tap the tattoo as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, mentally specifying a target (to which the wearer must have line of sight). Instead of manifesting its stored power, the tattoo animates, drops to the ground, and scuttles toward the target. The original wearer need no longer concentrate on the tattoo once animated.
The animated tattoo moves toward its designated target in the same round when it is activated. Treat it as a Fine construct that has AC 18, 10 hit points, a hardness of 5, speed 30 feet, and a bonus on attack rolls equal to the wearer’s manifester level + his key ability modifier. Crawling tattoos, unlike true constructs, are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and similar effects. Should the target be killed, teleport away, or otherwise absent itself before the animated tattoo reaches it, the wearer can reclaim the tattoo. If it is destroyed, a crawling tattoo shatters and evaporates.
A crawling tattoo must enter the target’s square to attack and thus provokes attacks of opportunity as it passes through the target’s threatened area. The tattoo makes one touch attack  per round thereafter until it strikes its target or is destroyed. On a successful attack, the power scribed in the crawling tattoo affects the target if the target fails the appropriate saving throw; however, powers that normally allow a Reflex saving throw automatically affect the touched target. Crawling tattoos can ferry beneficial powers as well as harmful ones, and a target can allow the tattoo’s touch attack to succeed if he or she desires.
Two examples of crawling tattoos are described below; many more types are possible.
Market Price: The cost of a crawling tattoo depends on the level of the power scribed in it.

Crawling Tattoo of Concussion: This crawling tattoo delivers a concussion effect, dealing 1d6 points of damage to a creature hit by its touch attack.
Faint psychokinesis; ML 1st; Craft Universal Item, concussion blast; Price 50 gp.
Crawling Tattoo of Energy Bolt: Each of these tattoos is keyed to one energy type: cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. This crawling tattoo delivers the energy bolt power, dealing 5d6 points of damage of its energy type.
Faint psychokinesis; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, energy bolt; Price 750 gp.
Crystal Anchor: A crystal anchor is a shaft of transparent crystal 4 to 5 feet in length, with a sharpened, spearlike head on one end. It ensnares the minds of those within range who manifest powers of a specified psionic discipline. The triggering discipline is specified at the time of creation.
A crystal anchor is activated by plunging the sharp head into the ground, leaving the shaft freestanding. It projects an invisible, 30-foot-radius field. If a power from the speci- fied discipline is manifested within this range, the manifester must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + power level) or become subject to an effect similar to brain lock, except that the effect is permanent until dispelled or dismissed by the individual who initially drove the crystal anchor into the earth. Any anchor can be pulled out of the ground and reused at a later time.
When a crystal anchor successfully ensnares a target, a slender filament of insubstantial ectoplasm connects the victim to the shaft, even one outside the original area of the field.
A crystal anchor can attempt to ensnare a victim only five times per day. Previously caught targets can remain caught day after day and do not count against this daily limit on attempts.
An anchor’s owner can designate certain creatures to be unaffected by the anchor; such creatures need not make a saving throw and do not count against the daily limit on attempts. One crystal anchor can ensnare multiple targets simultaneously, and multiple crystal anchors can share overlapping fields.
Anchors that activate when a specific power is manifested in range are also possible, but are rarer.
A crystal anchor has AC 7, 15 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.

Crystal Masks: Each of the various types of crystal masks fits over the face of any Medium or Small humanoid, with slits for eyes and nostrils. The mask is transparent, although it distorts the wearer’s features. Leather straps attached to small holes on the sides of a mask enable the owner to affix the mask to his face.
Crystal masks confer special abilities or improved skills on their wearers.
A crystal mask is treated as eyewear or goggles for the purpose of determining which items can be worn on the body.

Eyes of Expanded Vision: These crystal lenses fit over the user’s eyes to expand his field of vision. Flanking opponents gain only a +1 bonus when attacking the user instead of +2 (rogues still get their full sneak attack damage because the wearer is still flanked). The wearer gains a +1 enhancement bonus on Spot checks but takes a –2 penalty on saves against gaze attacks.
Faint clairsentience; ML 1st; Craft Universal Item, ubiquitous vision; Price 3,000 gp.
Eyes of Power Leech: These crystal lenses fit over the user’s eyes. Once per day, the wearer is able to drain power points from another psionic creature or character by meeting its gaze as if using power leech. A selected target within 40 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Will save, or a connection of crackling energy is formed between the wearer and the victim. The connection drains 1d6 power points from the target for every round in which the wearer maintains concentration (to a maximum of 7 rounds). The wearer gains 1 power point from those drained from the target each round (subject to his normal maximum; points he cannot gain immediately are lost).
If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the Will save is 14 instead of 16.
Eyes of power leech have no effect on nonpsionic targets or psionic creatures with a current power point reserve of 0.
Moderate telepathy; ML 7th; Craft Universal Item, power leech; Price 10,080 gp.
Eyes of Power Leech, Vampiric: As eyes of power leech, except the wearer gains drained power points from the subject even if doing so would bring him over his normal maximum.

Moderate psychometabolism; ML 9th; Craft Universal Item, grip of iron; Price 14,000 gp.
Mirror of Mind Switch: This small hand mirror manifests its power once per day against a creature that sees its reflection within it, as a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet. Potential victims can attempt to avert their eyes or look away as they would from a normal gaze attack. A creature meeting its own gaze in the mirror must succeed on a DC 19 Will save, or its mind and the mind of the mirror’s wielder switch, as if by the mind switch power. Because the mirror is small, only a single creature can meet its own gaze. The wielder of the mirror is not affected by seeing himself.
Moderate telepathy; ML 11th; Craft Universal Item, mind switch; Price 19,800 gp; Weight 1/2 lb.
Mirror of Suggestion: This small hand mirror manifests its power up to twice per day against creatures that see their reflections within it, as a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet. Potential victims can attempt to avert their eyes or look away as they would from a normal gaze attack. A creature meeting its own gaze in the mirror must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected by a suggestion chosen by the mirror’s wielder. Because the mirror is small, only a single creature can meet its own gaze each round. The wielder of the mirror is not affected by seeing herself.
Faint telepathy; ML 3rd; Craft Universal Item, psionic suggestion; Price 3,600 gp; Weight 1/2 lb.
Mirror of Time Hop: This small hand mirror manifests its power up to twice per day against creatures that see their reflections within it, as a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet.

Because the mirror is small, only a single creature can meet its own gaze each round. The wielder of the mirror is not affected by seeing herself.
Faint psychoportation; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, time hop; Price 9,000 gp; Weight 1/2 lb.
Pearl, Brain Lock: This tiny pearly sphere speeds toward its target when hurled by its owner. He can hurl the pearl at any target within 130 feet that he can see and to which he has line of effect.

All types of psionic restraints prevent the free manifesting of powers.

Psychoactive Skins: Psychoactive skins (also sometimes called ectoshells) are fistsized globs of psionically charged ectoplasm. As a standard action, a psychoactive skin spreads over and covers a Medium or smaller creature that projects the proper command thought; the same command thought causes the skin to shrink back down to its former size. Each of the various psychoactive skins is charged with one of a wide array of powers that constantly affect the wearer.
A deployed skin completely covers the wearer and all his equipment like a second skin, allowing the wearer to see, hear, and breathe normally. It rolls away from various parts of the body as needed, such as when the wearer needs to eat or access a backpack. Held items or items specifically excluded are not covered by a psychoactive skin.
Up to three skins can be worn simultaneously, although only the outermost is active in any given round (the powers of hidden skins cannot be manifested). Skin layers can be changed with a command thought as a standard action, which causes a lower-layer skin to come to the surface.
Skin of the Chameleon: This psychoactive skin adjusts to surrounding textures and colors, continually granting the wearer a +10 enhancement bonus on Hide checks.
Faint psychometabolism; ML 3rd; Craft Universal Item, chameleon; Price 18,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.
Skin of the Claw: This psychoactive skin benefits only a wearer who has levels in psychic warrior. If such a character wears this skin, he can activate the claws of the beast power at will, as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. He can also dismiss the claws equally quickly.
Faint psychometabolism; ML 4th; Craft Universal Item, claws of the beast; Price 16,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.
Skin of the Defender: This psychoactive skin continually grants the wearer a +4 bonus to natural armor.
Faint psychometabolism; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, thicken skin; Price 32,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.
Skin of Fiery Response: This psychoactive skin answers the first attack made against the wearer in each round with an automatically manifested and targeted “ectoburst” against the attacker. The burst ejects from the skin on the wearer’s turn, making a ranged touch attack as described in the energy retort power, but the energy type chosen is always fire. If the attack hits, the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage as the ectoburst flames up and is consumed. This attack does not in any way hinder the wearer, count against her total actions for the round, or provoke attacks of opportunity.
Faint psychokinesis; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, energy retort; Price 60,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.
Skin of the Hero: This psychoactive skin continually grants the wearer a +3 deflection bonus to Armor Class, a +3 resistance bonus on all saving throws, and a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
Strong psychometabolism; ML 18th; Craft Universal Item, bend reality; Price 77,500 gp; Weight 2 lb.
Skin of Iron: This psychoactive skin affects the wearer as the psionic iron body power up to three times per day for 15 minutes with each use. When the skin’s power is not active, it has no protective qualities. Activating the psionic iron body effect is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
Strong metacreativity; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, psionic iron body; Price 129,600 gp; Weight 2 lb.

Ring of Self-Sufficiency: This crystalline ring continually grants the wearer a +10 competence bonus on Autohypnosis checks.
Moderate psychometabolism; ML 7th; Craft Universal Item, creator must have 10 ranks in Autohypnosis; Price 10,000 gp.
Shards: These universal items are tiny fragments of cast-off crystal imprinted with minuscule bits of psionic power. Using a shard requires grasping it and projecting a command thought as a standard action (most shards telepathically whisper their command word into the minds of living creatures who handle them). A shard grants a temporary competence bonus on one specific skill, ranging from +1 to +10. The granted bonus lasts until the skill is used or 10 rounds pass, whichever comes first. Once its effect is activated, a shard disintegrates immediately, whether or not the bonus granted by the shard is eventually used.
Moderate psychometabolism; ML 7th; Craft Universal Item, creator must have ranks in the specified skill at least equal to the imprinted bonus; Price 10 gp (+1), 40 gp (+2), 90 gp (+3), 160 gp (+4), 250 gp (+5), 360 gp (+6), 490 gp (+7), 640 gp (+8), 810 gp (+9), or 1,000 gp (+10).
Third Eyes: These objects appear as small crystals, always with at least one wide, flat facet, and contain a variety of powers. When the owner uses the proper command thought, the crystal adheres to the center of his forehead (the same command thought causes the third eye to disengage). Only one third eye can be worn at a time.
A third eye is treated as eyewear or goggles for the purpose of determining which items can be worn on the body.
Aware: This kind of third eye continually grants the wearer a +10 competence bonus on Spot checks.
Moderate clairsentience; ML 7th; Craft Universal Item, creator must have 10 ranks in Spot; Price 10,000 gp.
Conceal: While worn, a third eye conceal protects the wearer from view by all devices, powers, and spells that detect, inf luence, or read emotions or thoughts. This power protects against all mind-affecting powers and effects as well as information-gathering by clairsentience powers or effects (except for metafaculty); this item affects the wearer as if he enjoyed the benefit of the psionic mind blank power.
Strong telepathy; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, psionic mind blank; Price 120,000 gp.
Concentrate: This kind of third eye continually grants the wearer a +10 competence bonus on Concentration checks.

Penetrate: While worn, a third eye penetrate grants the wearer a +2 bonus on manifester level checks to overcome a creature’s power resistance.
Strong clairsentience; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, bend reality; Price 8,000 gp.
Powerthieve: While worn, a third eye powerthieve allows the wearer to borrow one power from a psionic target within 40 feet once per day. If the target fails a DC 16 Will save, it instantly loses one power of the wearer’s choice, and the wearer instantly gains temporary knowledge of this power.
The wearer can manifest the borrowed power normally if she has sufficient power points to pay for its cost. The wearer retains knowledge of the power for up to 70 minutes, at which time she loses knowledge of the power and the former owner regains it, regardless of the distance between them. If the former owner is dead, the wearer still loses the borrowed power.
Moderate telepathy; ML 7th; Craft Universal Item, thieving mindlink; Price 10,080 gp.
Repudiate: While worn, this powerful item allows the wearer to manifest dispel psionics once per day with a +20 modifier on the dispel check (the wearer uses the +20 modifier in place of his manifester level).
Strong psychokinesis; ML 20th; Craft Universal Item, dispel psionics; Price 43,200 gp.
Sense: The wearer of this kind of third eye can manifest clairvoyant sense at will.
Faint clairsentience; ML 3rd; Craft Universal Item, clairvoyant sense; Price 24,000 gp.

Torc of Free Will: This item is a band inlaid with precious metal, worn around the neck or upper arm. The wearer of a torc of free will is not affected by the brain lock power or items that produce brain lock effects (such as crystal anchors).
A torc is treated as an amulet for the purpose of determining which items can be worn on the body.
Faint telepathy; ML 3rd; Craft Universal Item, brain lock; Price 6,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.

A torc is treated as an amulet for the purpose of determining which items can be worn on the body.
Faint telepathy; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, power leech; Price 12,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.
Torc of Power Preservation: This item is a band inlaid with precious metal, worn around the neck or upper arm. The wearer of a torc of power preservation manifests all powers by paying power points equal to the standard cost minus 1 (minimum of 1).
A torc is treated as an amulet for the purpose of determining which items can be worn on the body.
Strong clairsentience; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, bend reality; Price 36,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.

CURSED ITEMS
d%
Curse
01–33
Backfire
34–66
Exhausting
67–100
Subversive
Backfire: The imbedded psionic effect of the cursed item targets the user instead of its intended target.
Exhausting: A cursed item of this sort resembles a normal psionic item with a power that can be freely activated, but it instead drains the user of power points whenever he activates its power.
Subversive: A cursed item of this sort appears identical to a standard psionic item. However, it holds an inner malice for the wearer, whose saving throws take a constant –2 penalty. The owner isn’t instantly aware of this penalty but may become aware after a while, when it becomes clear that he fails saves that others make with the same result on the saving throw.

Specific Cursed Item
Reverse Capacitor: A reverse capacitor doesn’t store power points—it drains them, to the surprise and chagrin of a psionic character taken in by its resemblance to a cognizance crystal. Powers that identify psionic items incorrectly identify a reverse capacitor as a cognizance crystal 50% of the time.
A psionic character attempting to use the power points supposedly stored in a reverse capacitor instead loses 1d6 power points per round for 7 rounds. A crackling arc connects the brow of the character with the stone. If the character can put more than 40 feet between himself and the reverse capacitor, the effect ends. If the reverse capacitor drains more power points than the psionic character possesses, the draining effect ends.
The drained power points are simply lost. Each new attempt to use the power points supposedly stored in the reverse capacitor initiates the draining effect anew.
Strong telepathy; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, bend reality, power leech; Price 112,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

PSIONIC ARTIFACTS
Minor Artifacts
Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items, Instead, they are psionic items that no longer can be made, at least by common mortal means.
Sutra of Tranquil Thought: This monastic tome describes ancient techniques of mental focus and is highly prized by psionic practitioners. If a psionic character who is not evil studies the work during one week of solitary contemplation, he gains 17 bonus power points and experience points sufficient to place him halfway into the next level of experience. Those who use their powers for evil are punished for their impertinence, losing 5d6 x 1,000 XP for defiling the book. In addition, an evil reader must make an immediate DC 15 Will save or become permanently confused as if affected by the insanity power. Only psychic chirurgery or similarly extreme measures can restore sanity.
The minds of nonpsionic beings are too clouded to benefit from the secrets of this book. To anyone without psionic aptitude, the book’s pages appear to contain nothing but elaborate patterns and drawings of mysterious beings. Once it is read, the book vanishes into the Astral Plane to an unknown destination. Even if it is found again, the same character cannot benefit twice from perusing its contents.
Strong telepathy; ML 20th; Weight 3 lb.

Major Artifacts
Major artifacts are unique items—only one of each such item exists. They are difficult to find and dangerous to handle, but once found, are often even more difficult to destroy. A major psionic artifact has only a single, specific means of destruction.
Annulus: This artifact is the ultimate psionic nullifier. Forged to keep enemies of vast psionic power at bay, the Annulus is an artifact that any psionic being should fear. It has been forgotten in the modern age, and merely finding it would precipitate a great upheaval across the planes.
The Annulus is a 1-foot-diameter ring of silvery material. Tiny slots, antennae, spheres, and other intricate projections decorate the exterior of the hoop; however, two smoothed lengths of the ring provide an adequate surface for grasping the item.
The Annulus has several powers, all of which require a wielder to tightly grasp the ring with at least one hand. When it is first grasped, knowledge of the artifact’s powers immediately flood the wielder’s mind. The wielder can access all powers of the Annulus at manifester level 20th.
• The Annulus generates a continuous catapsi effect within a 100-foot-radius of the wielder (who is unaffected).
• The wielder gains a +4 enhancement bonus on any attempt to resist an effect that deals ability damage.
• Once per day, the wielder can trigger ultrablast as a standard action.
• Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder can trigger an effect similar to psionic dimensional anchor that affects all creatures in a 50-foot radius.
The primary power of the Annulus, however, is psionic nullification. Once per year, the wielder can trigger this effect as a special action requiring 10 rounds of continuous concentration to complete. The wielder specifies a target or targets within a 100-foot radius, ranging from a specific psionic individual or item to a group of psionic beings that share the same philosophy. The nullification effect is accompanied by blasts of light, heat, and sound from the Annulus. Nonpsionic creatures and items are unaffected, as are nontargeted beings, but any psionic target—regardless of any protection it may possess—disintegrates in a terrific explosion. Nothing is left but floating dust.
It is relatively easy to nullify a single target or a small group of targets, but nullifying a more powerful being (such as a demigod or greater entity) or another major artifact taxes the Annulus to its limits. If it is used to nullify such a target, the artifact succeeds but is destroyed in the process and cannot be retrieved by any means.
Psicrown of the Crystal Mind: An elaborate crystalline psicrown etched with strange designs, this exceptional psicrown is so invested with power that it is considered an artifact.
The power points in the Psicrown of the Crystal Mind can be used to manifest any of the following powers at manifester level 20th (or at the wearer’s manifester level if it is higher than 20th).
• Burst
• Catfall
• Concealing amorpha, greater
• Concussion blast
• Daze, psionic
• Detect psionics
• Dominate, psionic
• Far hand
• Float
• Mindlink
• Inertial barrier
• Telekinetic force
• Telekinetic maneuver
• Telekinetic thrust
• Teleport, psionic
• Thicken skin
• True metabolism
The wearer of the Psicrown of the Crystal Mind also gains power resistance equal to 10 + his manifester level.
The Psicrown of the Crystal Mind has 1,000 power points when discovered. Anyone who dons the crown instantly knows the number of power points it has at the current time. The crown recharges itself, gaining back 1 power point per day if it currently has fewer than 1,000 points.
As a special one-time use of the psicrown, the wearer can channel all the remaining charges in the psicrown into an uncontrolled burst of energy. The wearer triggers this use as a standard action. All within 20 feet of the wearer take hit points of damage equal to half the power points left in the staff (Reflex DC 18 half). The wearer inhabits a tiny eye of calm at the center of the destruction and is unharmed, but the psicrown is reduced to a burned-out cinder.

CREATING PSIONIC ITEMS
To calculate the costs involved in creating a psionic item, refer to Creating Magic Items. Although that information deals with magic items, the price formulas presented there are identical to those for psionic items.
Creating psionic armor and psionic weapons is almost identical to the requirements for creating magic armor and magic weapons.
Creating Dorjes
To create a dorje, a character needs a small supply of materials, the most obvious being a chunk of crystal or the crystal shards of the dorje to be carved from or assembled. The cost of the materials is subsumed in the cost of creating the dorje—375 gp x the level of the power x the level of the manifester. Dorjes are always fully charged (50 charges) when created.
If an augmentable power is incorporated into a dorje at a higher manifester level than the minimum level required to manifest the power, each discharge of the power from the dorje is augmented to the limit of that higher manifester level. Alternatively, if you want to have a higher manifester level in the dorje, you must pay for the dorje as if the power was one level higher for each additional two manifester levels you want.
The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the dorje (or must have the power available in some other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s experience point total, she pays the cost (multiplied by 50) upon beginning the dorje in addition to the experience point cost for making the dorje itself. The act of working on the dorje costs a number of power points per day equal to the power point cost of the power that is being embedded in the crystal of the dorje.
Crafting a dorje requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.
Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Dorje.
Creating Power Stones
To create a power stone, a character needs a supply of incense and fine etching tools, the cost of which is subsumed in the cost of encoding the power stone—12.5 gp x the level of the power x the level of the manifester. All materials used to imprint a power stone must be fresh and unused. A character must pay the full cost for encoding each power stone no matter how many times she previously has imprinted the same power.
The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the power stone (or must have the power available in some other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s experience point total, she pays the cost upon beginning the power stone in addition to the experience point cost for making the power stone itself. The act of encoding triggers the power as if it had been manifested, costing the character an appropriate number of power points.
Encoding a power stone requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.
Item Creation Feat Required: Imprint Stone.
Creating Psicrowns
To create a psicrown, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a circlet, crown, or the pieces of the crown to be assembled. The cost of the materials is subsumed in the cost of creating the psicrown—375 gp x the level of the highest-level power x the level of the manifester, + 75% of the value of the next highest-level power (281.25 gp x the level of the power x the level of the manifester), + one-half of the value of any other powers (187.5 gp x the level of the power x the level of the manifester). Psicrowns are always created with full power points.
Alternatively, if you want to have a higher manifester level in the psicrown, you must pay for the psicrown as if the highest-level power is one level higher for each additional two manifester levels you want.
The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the psicrown (or must have the power available in some other form). If any of the powers has an XP cost, the creator must provide XP equal to 50 x that cost. This expense is in addition to the experience point cost for making the psicrown itself. The act of working on a psicrown costs a number of power points per day equal to the cost of manifesting each of the powers associated with the psicrown once per day.
Crafting a psicrown requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.
Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Psicrown.
Creating Psionic Tattoos
The creator of a psionic tattoo must have a patch of uncovered skin free of hair and fur, and at least a few containers in which to mix dyes. In addition, he needs special materials, usually to create dyes. The costs for materials and dyes are subsumed in the cost for scribing the psionic tattoo— 25 gp x the level of the power x the level of the manifester. All ingredients and materials used to scribe a psionic tattoo must be fresh and unused. The character must pay the full cost for scribing each psionic tattoo. (Economies of scale do not apply.)
The user of the psionic tattoo is both the manifester and the target; therefore, powers that target another creature cannot be stored in psionic tattoo form. Powers with a range of personal can be made into psionic tattoos, but they cost double the price of standard psionic tattoos.
The creator must know the power to be placed in the psionic tattoo (or must have the power available in some other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s XP total, he pays the XP cost upon beginning the scribing in addition to the experience point cost for making the psionic tattoo itself. The act of scribing triggers the power as if it had been manifested, costing the character an appropriate number of power points.
Scribing a psionic tattoo requires one day.
Item Creation Feat Required: Scribe Tattoo.
Creating Universal Items
To create a universal item, a character usually needs some sort of equipment or tools to work on the item. He also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the item. Universal item costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the given item prices as a guideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.
If powers are involved in the prerequisites for making the item, the creator must know the power to be placed in the item (or must have the power available in some other form). Any experience point cost for a prerequisite power is not incurred by the creator of the item. The act of working on the item requires a payment of power points appropriate to the power or powers associated with the item during each day of the item’s creation.
Crafting a universal item requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.
Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Universal Item.

SPECIAL MATERIALS
In addition to psionic items with imbedded powers, some substances have innate special properties.
Crystal, Deep: Deep crystal is crystal of above-average quality found at the hearts of large veins or deposits of mundane crystal (see below). Deep crystal is renowned for its strength and its psionically resonant nature. Mundane crystal is used for many items of psionic manufacture, such as dorjes, power stones, and psicrystals. Deep crystal is a better grade.
While a weapon made of deep crystal is no different from a mundane crystal weapon for a nonpsionic character, a psionic wielder of a deep crystal weapon can focus psionic power through it, increasing the damage that weapon deals. As a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, the wielder can channel psionic power into a melee weapon or ranged weapon made of deep crystal. For 2 power points, the deep crystal weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. The weapon will stay charged for 1 minute or until it scores its next hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this power on their ammunition. All missile weapons lose this effect if they miss. However, they may be recovered and charged again.
Any weapon made of deep crystal costs 1,000 gp more than its noncrystal counterpart. Any item could potentially be made out of deep crystal. Because deep crystal armor is considered to be made out of metal, druids cannot wear it.
Deep crystal has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and a hardness of 10.
Crystal, Mundane: Mundane crystal can be used in place of metal in weapons or armor, using a special forging process. The fortified crystal possesses the properties of a similar masterwork steel weapon or armor, except for visual appearance.
Weapons and armor made of mundane crystal cost the same amount to make as their masterwork counterparts. Any item could potentially be made with mundane crystal. Because mundane crystal armor is considered to be made out of metal, druids cannot wear it.
Mundane crystal properly forged has 25 hit points per inch of thickness and a hardness of 8.


Epic Magic Items
----------------

While not truly an artifact, the epic magic item is a creation of such power that it surpasses other magic items. Epic magic items are objects of great power and value. The following are typical characteristics of an epic magic item. In general, an item with even one of these characteristics is an epic magic item.
• Grants a bonus on attacks or damage greater than +5.
• Grants an enhancement bonus to armor higher than +5.
• Has a special ability with a market price modifier greater than +5.
• Grants an armor bonus of greater than +10 (not including magic armor’s enhancement bonus).
• Grants a natural armor, deflection, or resistance bonus greater than +5.
• Grants an enhancement bonus to an ability score greater than +6.
• Grants an enhancement bonus on a skill check greater than +30.
• Mimics a spell of an effective level higher than 9th.
• Has a caster level above 20th.
• Has a market price above 200,000 gp, not including material costs for armor or weapons, material component- or experience point-based costs, or additional value for intelligent items.
An epic magic item that grants a bonus beyond those allowed for normal magic items has a higher market price than indicated by the formulas for non-epic items.
Epic magic items are not artifacts. They are not unique, though they are certainly very rare, and anyone with the proper item creation feats can build them. Even an epic magic item can never grant a dodge bonus, and the maximum inherent bonus that can be applied to an ability score is +5. An epic magic item cannot be created that uses or mimics an epic spell. A major artifact might be able to mimic such a spell, however.

CREATING EPIC MAGIC ITEMS
The process of creating an epic magic item is very similar to creating a nonepic magic item. However, certain important differences exist.

CASTER LEVEL
Spells with an effective level of 10th or higher are possible at epic levels. Because these spell slots aren’t automatically gained at a particular level like 0- to 9th-level spells are, they don’t have a minimum caster level. For this reason, the minimum caster level for any spell of 10th level or higher is set at 11 + spell level.

PREREQUISITES
In addition to the materials and tools required for nonepic magic items, any epic magic item requires at least two item creation feats: the epic and nonepic version.

MARKET PRICE
Use the guidelines for nonepic magic items to determine the market price of an epic magic item, with one addition: If the item gives a bonus beyond the limit allowed in for normal, nonepic magic items, multiply the portion of the market price derived from that characteristic by 10. Some epic characteristics, such as caster level, don’t trigger this multiplier.

EXPERIENCE POINT COST
The experience point cost to create an epic magic item is determined differently than for a normal magic item. For all epic magic items other than scrolls, divide the market price by 100, then add 10,000 XP to the result. The final number is the experience point cost to create the item.
For epic scrolls, divide the market price by 25 (as normal for creating a nonepic scroll), then add 1,000 XP to the result. The final number is the experience point cost to create the epic scroll.

MAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS
In the following sections, each general type of magic item, such as armor or scrolls, has an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items, if any. Each magic item description and table follows the same format used for nonepic magic items. Specific exceptions are noted as necessary.

ARMOR
Except when otherwise stated, epic magic armor and shields follow the rules for nonepic magic armor and shields.
There is no limit to the enhancement bonus of epic magic armor or shields, to the market price modifier of epic magic armor or shield special abilities, or to the total enhancement bonus and market price modifier of epic magic armor or shields.

EPIC ARMOR AND SHIELD BASE PRICE
To find the base price of an epic suit of magic armor or an epic magic shield, roll on Table: Armor and Shields. Note that the +6 to +10 rows apply only to armor and shields that provide an enhancement bonus of +6 to +10 or armor and shields with a single special ability whose market price modifier is +6 to +10. Magic armor and shields with a total effective bonus of +6 to +10 but that have an enhancement bonus of +5 or less and special abilities whose individual market price modifiers are +5 or less use the table for nonepic magic armor to determine price.

EPIC ARMOR AND SHIELD SPECIAL ABILITY DESCRIPTIONS
Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have special abilities, such as those detailed below and nonepic abilities. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

Acid Warding: The armor absorbs the first 50 points of acid damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, protection from energy; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Cold Warding: The armor absorbs the first 50 points of cold damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, protection from energy; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Exceptional Arrow Deflection: This shield functions like a shield of arrow deflection except that it can deflect any type of ranged attack (including spells that require a ranged touch attack) as if it were an arrow. Any time the bearer would normally be struck by a ranged attack, he or she can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20). If the ranged attack has an enhancement bonus (or a spell level), the DC increases by that amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the attack. The bearer must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn’t count as an action.
Caster Level: 23rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, shield, wall of force; Market Price: +8 bonus.
Fire Warding: The armor absorbs the first 50 points of fire damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, protection from energy; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Great Invulnerability: This suit of armor or shield grants the wearer damage reduction. The damage reduction can be 10/magic, 15/magic, 5/epic, or 10/epic, depending on the armor.
Caster Level: 19th (10/magic), 20th (15/magic), 21st (5/epic), 22nd (10/epic); Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, stoneskin, wish, or miracle; Market Price:+4 bonus (10/magic),+5 bonus (15/magic),+6 bonus (5/epic),+7 bonus (10/epic).
Great Reflection: Any time its bearer of this shield is targeted with a spell, it automatically reflects the spell back at the caster (as the spell turning spell). The wearer can lower or raise this effect as a free action (thus allowing beneficial spells in as desired).
Caster Level: 25th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, spell turning; Market Price: +10 bonus.
Great Spell Resistance: This suit of armor or shield grants the wearer spell resistance. The spell resistance can be 21, 23, 25, or 27, depending on the armor.
Caster Level: 21st (SR 21), 22nd (SR 23), 23rd (SR 25), 24th (SR 27); Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, spell resistance; Market Price: +6 bonus (SR 21), +7 bonus (SR 23), +8 bonus (SR 25), +9 bonus (SR 27).
Infinite Arrow Deflection: This shield functions like a shield of arrow deflection, though it can deflect any number of projectiles or thrown weapons each round. Any time the bearer would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he or she can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20). If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. The bearer must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn’t count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or ranged spells, can’t be deflected.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, protection from arrows, shield; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Lightning Warding: The armor absorbs the first 50 points of lightning damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).
Caster Level: 21st; Prereq-uisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, protection from energy; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Negating: Immediately after the wearer of this armor is hit with a magic weapon, the armor casts greater dispelling on the weapon. (In the case of projectile weapons, the armor casts greater dispelling on the weapon that fired the projectile if it is in range. If it is out of range, the armor does nothing.) No weapon can be affected by the armor more than once per day (regardless of the success of the dispel check).
Caster Level: 20th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, greater dispelling; Market Price: +5 bonus.
Sonic Warding: The armor absorbs the first 50 points of sonic damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, protection from energy; Market Price: +6 bonus.

SPECIFIC ARMORS AND SHIELDS

Antimagic Armor: This +1 negating full plate armor of invulnerability is crafted of adamantine (and thus has damage reduction 3/–). The armor provides a –5 penalty on dispel checks made against it or its wearer.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, greater dispelling, stoneskin, wish or miracle; Market Price: 871,500 gp; Cost to Create: 436,500 gp + 18,700 XP.
Armor of the Abyssal Horde: This+6 full plate armor’s clawed gauntlets are effectively +4 keen weapons (1d10/19–20) that afflict the target as if she had been struck by an energy drain spell (Fortitude negates DC 23). The armor bestows two negative levels on any nonevil creature wearing it. These negative levels persist as long as the armor is worn and disappear when the armor is removed. The negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the armor is worn.
Caster Level: 20th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be evil, energy drain; Market Price: 768,260 gp; Cost to Create: 385,260 gp + 17,660 XP.
Armor of the Celestial Battalion: This+7 chainmail is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without revealing its presence. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +10, no armor check penalty, and an arcane spell failure chance of 10%. It is considered light armor, and it allows the wearer to fly at will (as the fly spell). Furthermore, the wearer is at all times surrounded by a magic circle against evil effect (as the spell) which, if dispelled, can be created again as a free action.
Caster Level: 20th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be good, magic circle against evil; Market Price: 616,300 gp; Cost to Create: 308,300 gp + 16,160 XP.
Bulwark of the Great Dragon: This +6 heavy shield bears the image of a dragon’s head. Three times per day, the bearer of the shield can command it to belch forth a breath weapon of the appropriate type. The range of this breath weapon is 80 feet (if a line) or 40 feet (if a cone). Regardless of the type, the breath weapon deals 20d6 points of damage. In addition, the shield provides the bearer with resistance 50 to the energy type that matches its breath weapon. To determine what type of dragon shield is found, roll d% and consult the following table:

Dragonskin Armor: This+5 full plate armor is crafted from the hide of a great wyrm dragon. At the wearer’s command, the armor sprouts enormous dragon wings, allowing the wearer to fly at a speed of 90 feet (clumsy) for a total of 4 hours each day. The armor also grants immunity to a specific type of energy, based on the color of dragon that supplied the armor. Roll d% on the following table to determine the color and immunity.

WEAPONS
Except when otherwise stated, epic magic weapons follow the rules for nonepic magic weapons.  There is no limit to an epic magic weapon’s enhancement bonus, to the market price modifier of an epic magic weapon special ability, or to the total of an epic magic weapon’s enhancement bonus and market price modifier.

EPIC WEAPON BASE PRICE
To find the base price of an epic magic weapon, roll on Table: Weapons. Note that the +6 to +10 rows apply only to weapons that provide an enhancement bonus of +6 to +10 or weapons with a single special ability whose market price modifier is +6 to +10. Magic weapons with a total effective bonus of +6 to +10 but that have an enhancement bonus of +5 or less and special abilities whose individual market price modifiers are +5 or less use the table for nonepic magic weapons to determine price.

EPIC WEAPON SPECIAL ABILITY DESCRIPTIONS
Most magic weapons only have enhancement bonuses. They can also have special abilities, such as those detailed below and nonepic abilities. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

Acidic Blast: On command, an acidic blast weapon drips acid (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this acid splashes the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus acid damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of acid damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus acid damage upon their ammunition.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, acid fog; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Anarchic Power: This weapon is chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. When a weapon of anarchic power strikes a lawful target, this power deals +3d6 points of bonus chaotic damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of chaotic damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the anarchic power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic anarchic special ability.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, word of chaos; Market Price: +8 bonus.
Axiomatic Power: This weapon is lawful-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damager reduction. When a weapon of axiomatic power strikes a chaotic target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus lawful damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of lawful damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic axiomatic special ability.
Caster Level: 23rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, dictum; Market Price: +8 bonus.
Distant Shot: A distant shot weapon can be used against any target within line of sight at no penalty for range.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, discern location; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Dread: A dread weapon excels at attacking one type of creature. Against its designated foe, its effective enhancement bonus is +4 better than its normal enhancement bonus. Further, it deals +4d6 points of bonus damage against the foe, and if it scores a successful critical hit against the foe, that creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 27) or be destroyed instantly and turned to dust. (This even affects creatures immune to critical hits or death magic.) To randomly determine a dread weapon’s designated foe, roll on the following table.
Caster Level: 22nd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, summon monster IX; Market Price: +7 bonus.

Everdancing: An everdancing weapon is much like a dancing weapon, though it can be loosed with a free action and will fight as long as desired. It can move up to 60 feet away from its owner. Its owner can instruct it to move to a different target as a move-equivalent action. If its owner is rendered unconscious or otherwise unable to direct it, it will fight the same opponent as long as that opponent is conscious and within range. The owner of an everdancing weapon can grasp it again as a free action (assuming it is within reach).
Caster Level: 23rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects; Market Price: +8 bonus.
Fiery Blast: On command, a fiery blast weapon is sheathed in fire (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this fire engulfs the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus fire damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of fire damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus fire damage upon their ammunition.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, fireball; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Holy Power: This weapon is good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damager reduction. When a weapon of holy power strikes an evil target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus holy (good) damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of holy (good) damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any evil creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the holy power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic holy special ability.
Caster Level: 23rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, holy word; Market Price: +8 bonus.
Icy Blast: On command, an icy blast weapon is sheathed in icy cold (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this cold washes over the creature struck, dealing	+3d6 points of bonus cold damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of cold damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus cold damage upon their ammunition.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, cone of cold; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Lightning Blast: On command, a lightning blast weapon crackles with electrical energy (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, lightning coruscates around the creature struck, dealing	 +3d6 points of bonus electricity damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of electricity damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus electricity damage upon their ammunition.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, lightning bolt; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Mighty Disruption: Any undead creature struck in combat must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 21) or be destroyed. A weapon of mighty disruption must be a bludgeoning weapon. (If this property is rolled for a piercing or slashing weapon, reroll.)
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, true resurrection; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Sonic Blast: On command, a sonic blast weapon emits a low thrumming hum (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this becomes a thunderous roar that deals +3d6 points of bonus sonic damage to the creature struck. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of sonic damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus sonic damage upon their ammunition.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, shout; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Triple-Throw: This special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be thrown. (If this property is rolled for a weapon that cannot be thrown, reroll.) A triple-throw weapon creates two duplicates of itself when thrown. Both the original and the duplicate weapons attack separately (at the same attack bonus). Regardless of the success of any of the attacks, the duplicates immediately disappear after the attack is completed. Any bonuses on damage due to accuracy or precision (including those from sneak attacks, the Precise Shot feat, or the ranger’s favored enemy bonus) apply only to the original weapon’s damage, not to the duplicates.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, shades; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Unerring Accuracy: Ranged attacks made with this weapon negate the AC bonus granted by any cover short of total cover.  The weapon’s ranged attacks also ignore any miss chance from concealment (including total concealment, but the must still aim his or her attacks at the correct square).
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, true seeing; Market Price: +6 bonus.
Unholy Power: This weapon is evil-aligned and this bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. When a weapon of unholy power strikes a good target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus unholy (evil) damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of unholy (evil) damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any good creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the unholy power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic unholy special ability.
Caster Level: 23rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, unholy word; Market Price: +8 bonus.

SPECIFIC WEAPONS

Backstabber: This +6 short sword adds +2d6 to the wielder’s sneak attack damage. If the wielder does not have the sneak attack ability, this weapon does not grant it.

Furthermore, any arrows loosed from the bow are considered keen, regardless of the enhancement bonus of the arrow fired.
Caster Level: 23rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, bull’s strength, keen edge, true seeing; Market Price: 2,900,400 gp; Cost to Create: 1,450,400 gp + 39,400 XP.

Gripsoul: Gripsoul is a +6 keen long-sword, but instead of dealing additional damage on a critical hit, the weapon imprisons the victim in a gem set in the pommel of the sword as per a binding spell heightened to 16th level (DC 30). The same is true of any blow that would otherwise kill a foe or knock him or her unconscious. Only one creature can be so held, but the wielder can release the bound soul at any time with a command word.
Caster Level: 27th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, binding; Market Price: 1,856,500 gp; Cost to Create: 934,500 gp + 28,440 XP.

Quarterstaff of Alacrity: Both ends of this +5 quarterstaff of speed have equal enhancement and special powers, meaning that it allows an additional attack with each end every round. While the quarterstaff of alacrity is held, it grants its wielder a +5 resistance bonus on Reflex saves. It also deflects ranged weapons as if the wielder had the Deflect Arrows and Infinite Deflection feats.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, protection from arrows, shield; Market Price: 462,600 gp; Cost to Create: 231,600 gp + 14,620 XP.

Each negative level bestowed grants the wielder 5 temporary hit points. One day after being struck, the subject must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) for each negative level or lose a level. If this sword’s power causes a character to have negative levels at least equal to his or her current level, the character is instantly slain and the wielder gains an additional 10 temporary hit points.

Unholy Despoiler: In the hands of any character other than a blackguard, this sword performs as a +3 unholy longsword. In the hands of a blackguard, this weapon functions as a +7 longsword of unholy power and grants a +5 profane bonus on the wielder’s saving throws against spells with the good descriptor or spells cast by good characters. If a blackguard wielder smites good with the unholy despoiler, he or she adds twice his or her blackguard level to damage (rather than his or her blackguard level).
Caster Level: 23rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, blasphemy, unholy aura, unholy blight; Market Price: 4,650,315 gp; Cost to Create: 2,325,315 gp + 56,500 XP.

Caster Level: 20th; Prerequisites: Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, iron body, shatter; Market Price: 600,000 gp; Cost to Create: 300,000 gp + 16,000 XP.
Epic Psionics: This special crystal ring comes in a variety of types useful only to psionic characters (characters who have power points per day). The wearer’s total power points per day are increased, depending on the ring. The points granted are not bonus points—while the ring is worn, it actually increases the wearer’s points per day, but a night’s rest is required before gaining access to the increased power point per day total. (Power points are not actually stored in the ring, as would be the case for a crystal capacitor. Instead, the ring grants power points by magnifying the manifester’s own power.)
A ring of epic psionics V increases the wearer’s daily power points by 43 points, a ring of epic psionics VI grants 63 power points, a ring of epic psionics VII grants 87 power points, a ring of epic psionics VIII grants 115 points, and a ring of epic psionics IX grants 147 power points.

EPIC ROD DESCRIPTIONS
Standard epic rods are described below.

Besiegement:  This rod functions as a +3 light mace. In addition, it is useful for besieging fortifications. Whenever the wielder makes a charge attack, the rod improves to a +6 weapon. Twice per day, the rod can create a battering ram that lasts for 24 rounds. This ram can strike once per round, dealing 20 points of damage with each hit. It cannot be used to target individuals, only fortifications. It can be damaged by normal means (65 hp, AC 22), and disintegrate or dispel magic destroys it. The rod also has the following powers: Siege Engine: One heavy catapult, two light catapults, or three siege towers may be generated with each use of this power. Each weapon created lasts for 12 hours.  The power can be used three times per day. Ammunition for 20 shots is included with each weapon created.
Transmute Rock to Mud: This power can be used three times per day (caster level 24th, save DC 17).
Caster Level: 24th; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, clenched fist, passwall,  telepathic bond, transmute rock to mud; Market Price: 447,745 gp; Cost to Create: 224,025 gp + 14,474 XP.
Epic Absorption: Like a rod of absorption, this rod draws single-target or ray spells and spell-like abilities into itself, nullifying the effect and storing the potential spell levels until the wielder releases the energy in the form of spells of his or her own. Spells of any level (including those boosted beyond 9th level by metamagic) can be absorbed, although epic spells cannot. The rod absorbs a maximum of 150 spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged.
Caster Level: 23rd; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, empowered maximized spell turning; Market Price: 1,500,000 gp.
Epic Cancellation: This rod’s touch drains an item of all magical properties, including the magical energy in epic magic items (but not most artifacts). The item touched gets a Will saving throw (DC 26). If a creature is holding the magic item at the time, then the item can use the holder’s Will save bonus in place of its own. In such cases, contact is established by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining three items, the rod becomes brittle and useless. Drained items can only be restored by wish, miracle, or epic spells specifically designed to restore lost power. A rod of epic cancellation can neutralize a normal sphere of annihilation without itself being cancelled.
Caster Level: 25th; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, dispel magic; Market Price: 330,000 gp.
Epic Might: This rod is similar to a rod of lordly might, although it is far more powerful. It is larger than its normal counterpart, and it is constructed of adamantine rather than normal metal. It has six buttons, several spell-like functions, and several mundane uses, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts.
The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.
• Dominate Person: Touched foe is recipient of a dominate person spell, if the wielder so commands (Will save DC 24). The wielder must choose to use this power and then succeed with a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.
• Stun: Upon command, all enemies viewing the rod are stunned, as per the power word, stun spell (10-foot maximum range, Will save DC 24). Invoking this power is a standard action.
• Damage: Upon command, the rod deals 10d8 points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack and cures the wielder of a like amount of damage (Will save DC 26). The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with dominate person.
The following weapon uses of the rod have no limits on their use.
• In its normal form, the rod can be used as a	 +6 heavy mace.
• When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 longsword of fiery blasting.
• When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +8 battleaxe.
• When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +10 shortspear or +10 longspear.
The following mundane uses of the rod also have no limits on their use.
• Climbing pole/ladder: When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 150 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 10,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5.
• The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod’s base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength bonus of	+24.
• When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder a knowledge of his or her approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.
Caster Level: 30th; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, cure critical wounds, inflict critical wounds, bull’s strength, fireball, dominate person, power word stun; Market Price: 4,293,432 gp; Cost to Create: 2,151,372 gp + 52,841 XP.
Epic Negation: This rod negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items, including epic magic items (but not artifacts). The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray negates any currently active item function and has a 75% chance to negate any other spell or spell-like functions of that device, regardless of the level or power of the functions, for 2d4 rounds. To negate instantaneous effects, the rod wielder needs to have readied an action. The target item gets no saving throw or means to resist this effect. The rod can function three times per day.
Caster Level: 24th; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, dispel magic, limited wish or miracle; Market Price: 446,000 gp.
Epic Rulership: This rod appears to be a royal scepter worth at least 25,000 gp in materials and work-manship alone. The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 360 feet when he or she activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 900 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 17 or higher are entitled to a Will saving throw (DC 29) to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if he or she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be used for 1,500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous.
Caster Level: 25th; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened mass charm; Market Price: 575,000 gp; Cost to Create: 300,000 gp + 15,500 XP.
Epic Spellcaster: This magnificent adamantine rod grants its wielder a +10 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks made to cast epic spells for as long as he or she holds or carries the rod.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod; Market Price: 245,400 gp.
Epic Splendor: This rod grants its wielder a +8 enhancement bonus to Charisma for as long as he or she holds or carries the item. Three times per day, the rod creates and garbs him or her in clothing of the finest fabrics, plus adornments of fur and jewels. Apparel created by the rod can remain in existence up to 24 hours. The value of the garb ranges from 70,000 to 100,000 gp (1d4+6 x10,000 gp)—10,000 gp for the fabric, 50,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for jewel trim (maximum of 40 gems, maximum value 1,000 gp each). In addition, the rod can, once per week, create a palatial mansion in any floor plan the user desires. The mansion is palatial, able to accommodate up to 250 people, housing them in private chambers and serving them fine banquets. The mansion lasts for three days, after which time it, and everything originally in it (including items removed from the mansion), disappear.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, fabricate, mage’s magnificent mansion; Market Price: 297,400 gp; Cost to Create: 191,200 gp + 12,124 XP.
Excellent Magic: Once per day when casting a nonepic or epic spell that has an experience point component, the rod supplies up to 2,000 XP, not the caster. If more experience points are required to cast the spell, the caster provides them. As a special use of the rod, the caster can substitute the power inherent in the rod for the experience point development cost of an epic spell. Doing so drains all the power from the rod, rendering it useless.
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod; Market Price: 650,000 gp; Cost to Create: 325,000 gp + 26,000 XP.
Fortification: This rod functions as a +3 light mace. In addition, it is useful for the construction and defense of fortifications. Whenever the wielder is benefiting from cover, the rod improves that to nine-tenths cover (+10 cover AC bonus and +4 cover Reflex save bonus; failure on the save results in half damage and success results in no damage). Three times per day, the rod can create food and water, as per the cleric spell, for twenty-four people. The rod also has the following powers: Fortify: Four times per day, a stone wall can be created that is 12 inches thick, 10 feet high, and 30 feet long. This wall has a parapet and battlements across the top. (Alternatively, the power can be used to mend a broken existing wall. The gap to be filled can be no more than 300 square feet in area.) In addition, once per day, a great door of iron can be created that is set into one of the newly created walls. This door, 4 inches thick, may be a double door, a drawbridge, or a portcullis, as chosen by the wielder. Siege Engine: One heavy catapult, two light catapults, or three ballistae may be generated with each use of this power. The power can be used four times per day. Ammunition for 20 shots is included with each weapon created.
Caster Level: 24th; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, inter-posing hand, create food and water, major creation, wall of iron, wall of stone; Market Price: 465,665 gp; Cost to Create: 231,985 gp + 14,634 XP.
Invulnerability: When held, this rod grants its wielder the following powers.
• +5 enhancement bonus to natural armor.
• +5 resistance bonus on saving throws.
• Damage reduction 15/adamantine.
• Immunity to critical hits.
• Spell resistance 32.
Caster Level: 20th; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, iron body, resistance, spell resistance; Market Price: 600,000 gp.
Nightmares: Anyone who comes within 20 feet of the wielder of this rod feels a grave sense of unease. Each person so affected must make a Will save (DC 17) or suffer the effects of a nightmare spell the next time he or she falls asleep. The wielder is immune to this effect. Three times per day, the wielder can utter a command word that causes the rod to emit a horrid, inhuman scream. Up to twenty of the closest creatures within a 30-foot radius who hear this terrible wail believe that their worst nightmares have become reality and suffer the effects of a wail of the banshee spell (DC 23).
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, nightmare, permanency, wail of the banshee; Market Price: 284,000 gp.
Paradise: This item creates a nondimensional space, similar in effect to a rod of security. However, the rod’s possessor and up to 999 other creatures can stay in complete safety for up to 1,000 days divided by the number of creatures affected. Natural healing takes place at five times the normal pace. The rod functions like its nonepic counterpart in all other ways.
Caster Level: 24th; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened gate; Market Price: 610,000 gp.
The Path: This rod serves as an aid to trailblazing and travel. It grants the wielder a +30 enhancement bonus on Wilderness Lore checks for tracking and Intuit Direction checks. The handle of the rod is hollow, functioning like a telescope. When the wielder peers through it, the limits of vision are three times normal (and spotting distances for encounters are tripled). In addition, the telescoping handle enables the wielder to view things as though affected by a true seeing spell. The rod also has the following powers. Map: Three times per day a section of the rod unrolls like a scroll from a tube, revealing a map of the surrounding area, centered on the location of the rod. The area shown on the map covers an area as small as 50 feet in radius to as large as 24 miles in radius, zooming in or out with a set of command words. The map reveals natural topography and all types of structures (even hidden ones), but it will not show the location of creatures.
Passage: Three times per day, this power allows the wielder and up to five others in a 20-foot radius to move unhindered through natural plant growth or bodies of water (as per the freedom of movement spell).
Bridge: Once per day, this power allows the user to create a 5-foot-wide, 40-foot-long stone cause-way across chasms and canyons. The bridge created lasts for 1 hour.
Pass without Trace: Once per day, this power can be used on the wielder and twenty others, for 21 minutes. It is otherwise as the spell of the same name (caster level 24th).
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, find the path, freedom of movement, pass without trace, wall of stone; Market Price: 306,870 gp.
Restless Death: The holder of this rod can rebuke or control undead as if he or she were four levels higher. (The rod doesn’t grant the ability to rebuke or control undead if the holder doesn’t already have it.) In addition, the wielder may speak a command word to cast animate dead. Any skeletons or zombies animated by the rod’s power are automatically controlled by the rod, up to the rod’s maximum limit of 42 HD, and they follow the orders of the rod’s wielder. These undead don’t count toward the wielder’s limit of controlled undead. Finally, the wielder can speak a second command word to cast slay living (heightened to 10th level; DC 25).
Caster Level: 21st; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, animate dead, control undead, slay living; Market Price: 625,000 gp.
Wyrm: Any of the various rods in this series functions as a +5 quarterstaff. Upon casting the rod to the ground (a standard action) and uttering a command word, the rod grows into a specific type of dragon (depending on the specific type of rod) by the end of the round. The dragon created is a wyrm and obeys the commands of the owner. The dragon returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 500 feet from the owner. If the dragon form is slain, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated again for three days. A wyrm rod only functions if the possessor is of the same alignment as the dragon type.
Caster Level: 34th (white or brass), 35th (black or copper), 36th (green or bronze), 37th (blue or silver), 38th (red or gold); Prerequisites: Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened polymorph, creator must be same alignment as dragon type; Market Price: 1,458,200 gp (brass or white), 1,562,600 gp (black or copper), 1,670,600 gp (bronze or green), 1,782,200 gp (blue or silver), 1,897,400 gp (gold or red); Cost to Create: 729,400 gp + 24,576 XP (brass or white), 781,600 gp + 25,620 XP (black or copper), 835,600 gp + 26,700 XP (bronze or green), 891,400 gp + 27,816 XP (blue or silver), 949,000 gp + 28,968 XP (gold or red).

SCROLLS
To generate an epic scroll randomly, first roll on Table: Scroll Types to determine whether the spells are arcane or divine. An epic scroll contains 1d8 spells. For each spell, roll on Table: Epic Scroll Spell Levels to determine its level and then on the appropriate section of Table: Actual Spell Levels to determine the spell’s actual level and total metamagic level adjustments. To determine the specific metamagic level adjustments, roll on the appropriate section of Table: Metamagic Level Adjustment to Spells. To determine the spell, use the appropriate sections of the nonepic scroll tables.

STAFFS
Staffs have 50 charges when created, and they can’t be recharged.
Staffs use the wielder’s ability score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their spells in such cases where those values would be higher than the listed values for the staffs.

• Meteor swarm(heightened to 12th, 2 charges, DC 30)
• Summon monster IX (extended, 2 charges, elder fire elemental only) A staff of fiery power can be broken in a retributive strike. The breaking of the staff must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot- radius globe. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take points of damage equal to eight times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take six times the number of charges in damage, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take four times the number of charges in damage. Successful Reflex saving throws (DC 17) reduce the damage sustained by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence; if he or she does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him or her. After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +5 quarterstaff with no special abilities. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be broken in a retributive strike.)

Gate Key: When properly operated, the gate key can be used to attune any bounded space, such as a doorway or a cave opening, to another bounded space on another plane of existence previously visited by the wielder. When two bounded spaces are attuned, an interdimensional portal springs up at each location, and the two portals are connected. When the wielder creates a pair of portals, he or she also establishes the necessary key that travelers must have to access the portal. Possible keys include nothing, a pearl, a particular hair color, or even the gate key itself. Up to sixty different pairs of portals can be attuned in this manner. Once all sixty pairs of portals are created, the key cannot create additional gates, though it may still be the necessary key to access some or all of the portals. To any creature without the proper key, the interdimensional portals are not visible (through true seeing or similar magic reveals their presence).

INTELLIGENT ITEMS
Just like nonepic magic items, epic magic items sometimes possess intelligence of their own. Such items are fully sentient and should be treated as NPCs. The Random Epic Magic Items section details the chances that epic armor, shields, rings, rods, staffs, wondrous items, and weapons might be intelligent. In short, a ring, rod, staff, wondrous item, armor, or shield has a 1% chance to be intelligent, a ranged weapon has a 5% chance to be intelligent, and a melee weapon has a 15% chance to be intelligent. Rather than using the tables for nonepic items, use the tables below to determine the properties of an intelligent item: the number of powers, unusual properties, alignment, and special purpose of the item (if any). Of the three mental ability scores, two scores are favored (2d6 + some number) and one is completely random (3d6). Choose which scores get assigned which number, or roll 1d4 and determine randomly according to the following table.

MARKET PRICE MODIFIER
To find the market price for an epic magic item, use these expanded guidelines, adjusting as necessary to find an appropriate final price. Each point of Intelligence bonus, Wisdom bonus, or Charisma bonus increases the item’s market price by 400 gp. Any form of communication possessed by the item increases its market price by the number shown on Table: Epic Item Communication. Each primary ability possessed by the item increases its market price by 2,000 to 10,000 gp (average 6,000 gp). Each extraordinary ability possessed by the item increases its market price by 15,000 to 35,000 gp (average 25,000 gp). A special purpose increases the item’s market price by 50,000 gp. An awesome power increases the item’s market price by 100,000 gp.

INTELLIGENT ITEM ALIGNMENT
Any item with Intelligence has an alignment. Make sure that the alignment choosen or determine randomly (using Table: Item Alignment) matches any alignment-oriented special abilities of the item. Any character whose alignment is not compatible with that of the item gains one negative level for every 10 points of the weapon’s Ego (see Item Ego, below) if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this never results in actual level loss, the negative levels remain as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells). These negative levels are cumulative with any other penalties the item might already place on inappropriate wielders.

1 The item can also be used by any character whose alignment corresponds to the nonneutral portion of the item’s alignment (in other words, chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). Thus, any chaotic character (CG, CN, CE) can use an item with chaotic neutral alignment.

ITEM COMMUNICATION
Like a character, an intelligent item speaks Common plus one language per point of Intelligence bonus. Choose appropriate languages, taking into account the item’s origin and purposes. An item with multiple modes of communication can use any of its modes at will.

Roll d%: 01–05, the item cannot read any languages; 06–75, the item can read any language it can speak (+1,000 gp to market price); 76–90, it can read all languages (+2,000 gp to market price); 91–100, it can read all languages as well as read magic (+3,000 gp to market price).

Roll on Table: Intelligent Item Extraordinary Powers instead

If the same ability is rolled twice or more, the range, frequency, or effectiveness of the power is doubled, tripled, and so on. All abilities function only when the item is held, drawn, or otherwise brandished and the possessor is concentrating on the desired result. Activating a power is a standard action, but using a free feat is not. Feats may be used regardless of prerequisites, but the item still must be held and drawn (or worn, in the case of such items). An intelligent item might activate a power on its own.

SPECIAL PURPOSE POWER
A special purpose power operates only when the item is in pursuit of its special purpose. This is always up to the purview of the item. It should always be easy and straightforward to see how the ends justify the means. That is to say that if the player’s reasoning for how a particular action serves the item’s purpose is not completely believable, the item won’t allow it.

ITEM EGO
Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an item possesses. Only after all aspects of an item have been generated and recorded can its Ego score be determined. Ego is a factor with regard to the dominance of item over character, as detailed below.

ITEMS AGAINST CHARACTERS
When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is, of course, absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment’s goals or the item’s special purpose, personality conflict—item against character—results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with the item. When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = item’s Ego). If the possessor succeeds, he or she is dominant. If he or she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for one day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either item or character, and so on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character’s desires and demands concessions such as any of the following:
• Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.
• The character divesting him or herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.
• Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.
• Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.
• Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is not in use.
• That the character carry the item with him or her on all occasions.
• That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.

In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures.
• Force its possessor into combat.
• Refuse to strike opponents.
• Strike at its wielder or his or her associates.
• Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.
• Cause itself to drop from the character’s grasp.

Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character’s and item’s alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily command him or her, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals. All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are rivals of each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract their host so that he or she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior.
Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters who possess them, even though they may never successfully control their possessor. They may be powerless to force their demands but remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and demands.

ARTIFACTS

MINOR ARTIFACTS
Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items, but rather magic items that no longer can be made by common mortal means—even by the hands of epic creators. Such items have no established market price. Below is a selection of known minor artifacts.

Everfull Purse: This leather belt pouch has the power to turn a single gold coin into many overnight. If a single gold piece is placed in the everfull purse at sunset, it will be replaced at sunrise by 25 gold pieces. The purse has no effect if more than one gold piece is left within, or if anything other than gold is placed within.
Caster Level: 20th; Weight: 1/2 lb.
Libram of Gainful Conjuration: This mystic book is of great value to arcane spellcasters of good alignment (LG, NG, CG). Study of the work requires one week. Upon completion, the good arcane caster gains a +1 inherent bonus to the ability score controlling his or her arcane spellcasting ability and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose one of the classes to be affected.) Nongood arcane spellcasters (LN, N, CN, LE, NE, or CE) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and must atone (see the atonement spell) in order to gain any further experience. Anyone incapable of casting arcane spells who reads even a single word of the work must make a Will save (DC 20) or suffer insanity (see the insanity spell). Except as indicated above, the writing in a libram of gainful conjuration can’t be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.
Caster Level: 19th; Weight: 3 lb.
Libram of Ineffable Damnation: This mystic book is of great value to arcane spellcasters of evil alignment (LE, NE, CE). Study of the work requires one week. Upon completion, the evil arcane caster gains a +1 inherent bonus to the ability score controlling his or her arcane spell-casting ability and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose one of the classes to be affected.) Nonevil arcane spellcasters (LN, N, CN, LG, NG, or CG) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and must atone (see the atonement spell) in order to gain any further experience. Anyone incapable of casting arcane spells who reads even a single word of the work must make a Will save (DC 20) or suffer insanity (see the insanity spell). Except as indicated above, the writing in a libram of ineffable damnation can’t be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.
Caster Level: 19th; Weight: 3 lb.
Libram of Silver Magic: This mystic book is of great value to arcane spellcasters of neutral alignment (LN, N, CN). Study of the work requires one week. Upon completion, the neutral arcane caster gains a +1 inherent bonus to the ability score controlling his or her arcane spellcasting ability and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose one of the classes to be affected.) Evil or good arcane spellcasters (LE, NE, CE, LG, NG, or CG) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and must atone (see the atonement spell) in order to gain any further experience. Anyone incapable of casting arcane spells who reads even a single word of the work must make a Will save (DC 20) or suffer insanity (see the insanity spell). Except as indicated above, the writing in a libram of silver magic can’t be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.
Caster Level: 19th; Weight: 3 lb.
Manual of Puissant Skill at Arms: This treatise contains expert advice and instruction in the arts of combat. Any barbarian, fighter, monk, paladin, or ranger who spends one week studying the manual gains a +1 inherent bonus to Strength and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one of the classes listed, he or she must choose one of the classes to be affected.) A character without any levels in one of the classes listed gains no bonus from the work, but if an arcane spellcaster without levels in one of the classes listed scans even a single word he or she will lose 2dx1,000 XP and must make a Will save (DC 20) or have 1 point of Intelligence permanently drained. Except as indicated above, the writing in a manual of puissant skill at arms can’t be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.
Caster Level: 19th; Weight: 3 lb.
Manual of Stealthy Pilfering: This guide to thievery grants any rogue who spends a week studying its lessons a +1 inherent bonus to Dexterity and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. A character without any rogue levels gains no bonus from the work, but if a divine spellcaster without rogue levels scans even a single word she will lose 2dx1,000 XP and must make a Will save (DC 20) or have 1 point of Wisdom permanently drained. Except as indicated above, the writing in a manual of stealthy pilfering can’t be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.
Caster Level: 19th; Weight: 3 lb.
Rogue’s Dice: This pair of cubes appears much like any other pair of typical (6-sided) dice. A character with a pair of rogue’s dice who wishes to roll them must announce that he or she is rolling the dice (accidental rolls have no effect). Rolling the dice is a standard action, and both dice must be rolled simultaneously to have any effect. The player should roll 2d6 and consult the table below to determine the dice’s affects.
2d6
Effect
2
Lose 10,000 XP and dice roll again next round
3
Permanently lose 1d4+1 Dex
4
Gain 1d4 negative levels (Fortitude DC 20 to remove)
5
–1 penalty on all attacks, saves, and checks for 1 hour
6
–4 penalty to AC for 10 minutes
7
+1 morale bonus on attacks and on saves against fear for 10 minutes
8
Gain effects of blur for 10 minutes
9
+1 insight bonus on all attacks, saves, and checks for 1 hour
10
Gain effects of freedom of movement for 1 hour
11
Gain one limited wish (must be used within 1 minute)
12
Gain 10,000 XP and may roll again next round
No character can gain any effect from an additional roll of the dice within 24 hours, with two exceptions. If a 2 is rolled, the dice automatically roll themselves at the beginning of the character’s next turn and he or she must accept the additional result. If a 12 is rolled, the character may choose to roll again in the next round (if more than 1 full round elapses between the roll of 12 and this bonus roll, the character loses the bonus roll). There is no method (mundane or magical) to predict or influence the result of a roll of Rogue’s dice. Even powerful divination magic can’t predict the outcome of a roll before it is made.
Caster Level: 20th; Weight: —.

MAJOR ARTIFACTS

Axe of the Dwarvish Lords: This is a +6 keen throwing goblinoid bane dwarven waraxe. Any dwarf who holds it doubles the range of his or her darkvision. Any nondwarf who grasps the Axe takes 2 points of temporary Charisma damage; these points cannot be healed or restored in any way while the Axe is held. The current owner of the Axe gains a +10 bonus on Craft (armorsmithing, blacksmithing, gemcutting, stonemasonry, and weaponsmithing) checks. The wielder of the Axe can summon an elder earth elemental (as summon monster IX; duration 20 rounds) once per week.
Codex of the Infinite Planes: The Codex is enormous—supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone opening the Codex for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a destruction spell (Fortitude DC 30 for only 10d6 damage). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the Codex allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the insanity spell). The powers of the Codex of the Infinite Planes are as follows: astral projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, plane shift, and soul bind. Each is usable at will by the owner of the Codex (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The Codex of the Infinite Planes has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires both a Concentration check and a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can’t take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can only incur one catastrophe per power use, even if he or she fails both checks.
d%
Catastrophe
01–25
Natural Fury: An earthquake spell centered on the reader strikes every round for 1 minute, and an intensified storm of vengeance spell is centered and targeted on the reader.
26–50
Fiendish Vengeance: A gate opens and 1d3+1 balor demons, pit fiends, or similar evil outsiders immediately step through and attempt to destroy the owner of the Codex.
51–75
Ultimate Imprisonment: Reader’s soul is captured (as trap the soul; no save allowed) in a random gem somewhere on the plane while his or her body is entombed beneath the earth (as imprisonment).
76–100
Death: The reader utters a wail of the banshee and then is subject to a destruction spell. This repeats every round for 10 rounds until the reader is dead.
Cup and Talisman of the Demigod: The Cup is a large gem-set golden chalice requiring two hands to lift. It emits light (as the daylight spell) at all times and automatically dispels any darkness-based spells whose area it enters. If the cup is filled with holy water (requiring a full gallon), that substance will act as a potion of cure critical wounds or a potion of neutralize poison (owner’s choice) if drunk. This liquid can’t be saved or stored in any way. The Talisman is a small eight-pointed platinum star hanging from a chain of gold and pearls. The wearer gains a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma and may cast remove blindness/deafness, remove curse, and remove disease at will. Furthermore, if the Talisman is placed within the Cup and the Cup filled with holy water, that liquid acts as a special elixir of resurrection (as the spell). This effect will function only once per month. Any evil or chaotic creature that touches the Cup or Talisman is struck with a holy word (if evil) or dictum (if chaotic) spell (or both if the creature is chaotic evil).
Eye of the Orc: This lump of rock has a marquis-cut black sapphire set in its center, making it appear similar to a large eye. If possessed by an orc, it grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength and Charisma, and the orc’s darkvision range is doubled. Nonorcs who possess the Eye gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength but take a –2 penalty to Intelligence and Charisma. Regardless of the owner’s race, any weapon wielded by the owner of the Eye is considered an elf bane weapon. Furthermore, by holding the Eye before the character, he or she can perceive things as if he or she had true seeing cast upon him or her. This can be activated only once per day but lasts as long as the character concentrates on it (requiring a standard action each round).
Golem Armor: This enormous suit of black iron +10 full plate armor increases the wearer’s size by one category (to a maximum of Colossal). The wearer gains a +10 enhancement bonus to Strength and is rendered immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, disease, and similar effects. He or she is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage. Golem Armor is immune to rust attacks. The wearer of Golem Armor gains damage reduction 15/adamantine. He or she also cannot regain hit points by any means (mundane or magical) while the armor is worn. It requires 1 hour to don or extract oneself from Golem Armor.
Invulnerable Coat: The Invulnerable Coat +5 chain shirt of heavy fortification. It grants its wearer damage reduction 10/epic and resistance 20 against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic energy. If the wearer can turn undead, treat the wearer as having +4 class levels for purposes of caster level, turning undead, smiting evil, and laying on hands.
Iron Gauntlet of War: The Gauntlet grants a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength. The wearer doubles the damage bonus on any smite attacks he or she makes. If the wearer has the Leadership feat, the wearer’s Leadership score increases by +4, but the wearer can never attract or keep followers or cohorts who are good or chaotic. Once per day, the wielder can use implosion as a 20th-level caster (DC 23). The Iron Gauntlet of War is intelligent (Int 13, Wis 18, Cha 24, Ego 26) and lawful evil. It can communicate telepathically with its wearer, though it cannot speak. It will always seek to dominate any wearer who isn’t lawful evil, forcing such an owner to commit lawful evil deeds (or else find a more suitable wearer).
Ring of Nine Facets: This ring is set with a gem of nine facets, each one in-scribed with a different incomprehensible rune. Each day at sunrise, the gem turns to display a different facet. The active facet determines the Ring’s power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 to determine which facet (and thus which power) is active.

1d10
Active Facet Power
1
Wearer is immune to disease
2
Wearer needs no air to survive
3
Wearer gains +5 natural armor bonus
4
Wearer gains low-light vision
5
Wearer gains fast healing 1
6
Wearer can fly at will
7
Wearer gains cold resistance 30
8
Wearer gains freedom of movement
9
Wearer gains +5 resistance bonus on saving throws
10
Wearer may select which facet is active

The wearer of the Ring can, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt to change the active facet away from one he or she does not desire. This requires a full-round action and a Concentration check (DC 50), and deals 2d6 points of nonlethal damage regardless of success. If the save is successful, the new facet is determined randomly. If the Ring is removed, the former wearer takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage each minute until it is replaced or until his or her nonlethal damage exceeds his or her current hit points (though the nonlethal damage resumes again immediately when the former wearer regains consciousness).

Special Materials
-----------------

SPECIAL MATERIALS
In addition to magic items created with spells, some substances have innate special properties.
If you make a suit of armor or weapon out of more than one special material, you get the benefit of only the most prevalent material. However, you can build a double weapon with each head made of a different special material.

SPECIAL WEAPONS MATERIALS
Each of the special materials described below has a definite game effect. Some creatures have damage reduction based on their creature type or core concept. Some are resistant to all but a special type of damage, such as that dealt by evil-aligned weapons or bludgeoning weapons. Others are vulnerable to weapons of a particular material. Characters may choose to carry several different types of weapons, depending upon the campaign and types of creatures they most commonly encounter.

Adamantine: This ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or suit of armor. Weapons fashioned from adamantine have a natural ability to bypass hardness when sundering weapons or attacking objects, ignoring hardness less than 20. Armor made from adamantine grants its wearer damage reduction of 1/– if it’s light armor, 2/– if it’s medium armor, and 3/– if it’s heavy armor. Adamantine is so costly that weapons and armor made from it are always of masterwork quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Thus, adamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, and the armor check penalty of adamantine armor is lessened by 1 compared to ordinary armor of its type. Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine. An arrow could be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff could not.
Only weapons, armor, and shields normally made of metal can be fashioned from adamantine. Weapons, armor and shields normally made of steel that are made of adamantine have one-third more hit points than normal. Adamantine has 40 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 20.

Darkwood: This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light. Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow, an arrow, or a spear) made from darkwood is considered a masterwork item and weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type. Items not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a battleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from darkwood or do not gain any special benefit from being made of darkwood. The armor check penalty of a darkwood shield is lessened by 2 compared to an ordinary shield of its type. To determine the price of a darkwood item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item.
Darkwood has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5.

Dragonhide: Armorsmiths can work with the hides of dragons to produce armor or shields of masterwork quality. One dragon produces enough hide for a single suit of masterwork hide armor for a creature one size category smaller than the dragon. By selecting only choice scales and bits of hide, an armorsmith can produce one suit of masterwork banded mail for a creature two sizes smaller, one suit of masterwork half-plate for a creature three sizes smaller, or one masterwork breastplate or suit of full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, enough hide is available to produce a small or large masterwork shield in addition to the armor, provided that the dragon is Large or larger.
Because dragonhide armor isn’t made of metal, druids can wear it without penalty.
Dragonhide armor costs double what masterwork armor of that type ordinarily costs, but it takes no longer to make than ordinary armor of that type.
Dragonhide has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.

Iron, Cold: This iron, mined deep underground, known for its effectiveness against fey creatures, is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties. Weapons made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts. Also, any magical enhancements cost an additional 2,000 gp.
Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron, but a quarterstaff could not.
A double weapon that has only half of it made of cold iron increases its cost by 50%.
Cold iron has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.

Mithral: Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just as hard. When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create armor and is occasionally used for other items as well. Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light. Spell failure chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and armor check penalties are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).
An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of weapons, this lighter weight does not change a weapon’s size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether it is light, one-handed, or two-handed). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a scythe cannot be.)
Weapons or armors fashioned from mithral are always masterwork items as well; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below.
Mithral has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 15.

Silver, Alchemical: A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a weapon made of steel so that it bypasses the damage reduction of creatures such as lycanthropes.
On a successful attack with a silvered weapon, the wielder takes a –1 penalty on the damage roll (with the usual minimum of 1 point of damage). The alchemical silvering process can’t be applied to nonmetal items, and it doesn’t work on rare metals such as adamantine, cold iron, and mithral.
Alchemical silver has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.
